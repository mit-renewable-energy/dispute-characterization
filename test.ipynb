      "CHAPTER I. PROJECT OVERVIEW\n",
      "THE CLAIM AGAlNST WIND DEVELOPMENT\n",
      "Wind energy is the fastest growing domestic energy tesource. Between 1998 and 2002 installed capacity grew from 1848 MW to 4685 MW. a compound growth rate of 26 percent. Since wind energy is now broadly competitive with many traditional generation resources, there is wide expectation that the growth rate of the past five years will continue. (Source for statistics: www.awea.org).\n",
      "As the pace of wind project development has increased, opponents have raised claims in the media and at siting hearings that wind development will lower the value of property within view of the turbines. This is a serious charge that deserves ro be seriously examined.\n",
      "No EXISTING EMPIRICAL SUPPORT\n",
      "As a result of the expansion of capacity from 1998 ro 2002, it is reasonable to expect any nega tive effect would be revealed in an analysis of how already existing projects have affected property values. A search for either European or United States studies on the effect of wind development on property values revealed that no systematic review has as yet been undertaken.\n",
      "As noted above, rhe pace of development and siting hearings is likely to continue, which makes it important to do systematic research in order to establish whether there is any basis for the claims about harm to property values. (For recent press accounts of opposition claims see: The Charleston Gazette, WV, March 30, 2003; and Copley News Service. Ottawa, IL, April 11, 2003).\n",
      "This REPP Analytical Report reviews data on property sales in the vicinity of wind projects and uses statistical analysis to determine whether and the extent to which the presence of a wind power project has had an influence on the prices at which properties have been sold. The hypothesis underlying this analysis is that if wind development can reasonably be claimed to hurt property values. then a careful review of the sales data should show a negative effect on property values within the viewshed of the projects.\n",
      "A SERIOUS CHARGE SERIOUSLY EXAMINED\n",
      "The first step in this analysis required assembling a database covering every wind development that came on-line after 1998 with 10 MW installed capacity or greater. (Note: For this Report we cut off projects that came on-line after 200 I because they would have insufficient data at this time ro allow a reasonable analysis. These projects can be added in future Reports, however.) For the purposes of this analysis, the wind developments were considered to have a visual impact for the area within five miles of the turbines. The five mile threshold was selected because review of the literature and field experience suggests that although wind turbines may be visible beyond five miles, beyond this distance. they do not tend to be highly noticeable. and they have relatively little influence on the landscape's overall character and quality. For a time period covering roughly six years and straddling the on-line date of the projects, we gathered the records for all property sales for the view shed and for a community comparable to the view shed.\n",
      "I! REPI'\n",
      "__________________________ C_HAPTER Or-.:E - EXECUTIV.!' SL;M~~~_Y__\n",
      "For all projects for which we could find sufficient data. we then conducted a statistical analysis ro determine how properC)' values changed over time in the view shed and in the comparable com munity. This database contained more than 25,000 records of properry sales within the view shed Jnd the selected comparable communities.\n",
      "THREE CASE ExAMINATIONS\n",
      "REPP looked at price changes for eJch of the ten projects in thtee ways: Case 1 looked at the chJnges in the view shed and comparable community for the entire period of the study; Case 2 looked at how property values changed in the view shed before and after the project came on-line; Jnd Case 3 looked at how propetty values changed in the view shed and comparable community aftet the project came on-line.\n",
      "Case 1 looked first at how prices changed over the entire period of study for the view shed and comparable region. Where possible, we tried ro colleer data for three years preceding and three years following the on-line date of the project. For the ten projects analyzed, property values increased faster in the view shed in eight of the ten projects. In the rwo projects where the view shed values increased slower than for the comparable community. special circumstances make the tesults questionable. Kern County. California is a site that has had wind development since 1981. Because of the existence of the old wind machines, the site does not provide a look at how the new wind turbines will affect property values. For Fayette County, Pennsylvania the statistical explanation was very poor. For the view shed the statistical analysis could explain only 2 percent of the rotal change in prices.\n",
      "Case 2 compared how prices changed in the view shed before and after the projects came on-line. For the ten projects analyzed, in nine of the ten cases the property values increased faster after the project came on line than they did before. The only project to have slower property value growth after the on-line date was Kewaunee County. Wisconsin. Since Case 2 looks only at the view shed, it is possible that external factors drove up prices faster after the on-line date and that analysis is therefore picking up a facror other than the wind development.\n",
      "Finally, Case 3 looked at how prices changed for both the view shed and the comparable region, but only for the period after the projects came on line. Once again, for nine of the ten projects analyzed, the property values increased faster in the view shed than they did for the comparable commu nity. The only project ro see faster property value increases in the comparable community was Kern County, California. The same caution applied to Case I is necessary in interpreting these results.\n",
      "[f property values had been harmed by being within the view-shed of major wind developments, then we expected that to be shown in a majority of the projecrs analyzed. Instead, ro the contrary. we found that for the great majority of projects the property values actually rose more quickly in [he view shed than they did in the comparable community. Moreover, values increased faster in the view shed after the projects came on-line than they did before. Finally. after projects came on-line. \\'Jlues increased faster in the view shed than they did in the comparable community. In all. we Jna Iyzed ten projects in three cases; we looked at thirty individual analyses and found that in rwenty six of those. property values in the affected view shed performed better than the alternative.\n",
      "REPP I 2\n",
      "_~tl~££.~CT OF \\X'IND DEVElOP~tENTON LOCAL PROPERTY VALCES\n",
      "This study is an empirical review of the changes in property values over time and does not attempt to present a model to explain all the influences on property values. The analysis we con ducted was done solely to determine whether the existing data could be interpreted as supporting It would be desitable in future studies the claim that wind development harms property values. to expand the variables incorporated into the analysis and to refine the view shed in order to look at the relationship between property values and the precise distance from development. However, the limitations imposed by gathering data for a consistent analysis of all major developments done post-l998 made those refinements impossible for this study. The statistical analysis of all property sales in the view shed and the comparable community done for this Report provides no evidence that wind development has harmed property values within the view shed. The results from one of the three Cases analyzed are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1 below.\n",
      "REGRESSION ANALYSIS\n",
      "REPP used standard simple statistical regression analyses to determine how property values changed over time in the view shed and the comparable community. In very general terms, a regression analysis \"fits\" a linear relationship, a line. to the available database. The calculated line will have a slope. which in our analysis is the monthly change in average price for the area and time period studied. Once we gathered the data and conducted the regression analysis, we compared the slope of the line for the view shed with the slope of the line for the comparable community (or for the view shed before and after the wind project came on-line).\n",

      "While regression analysis gives the best fit for the data available, it is also important to consider how \"good\" (in a statistical sense) the fit of the line to the data is. The regression will predict values that can be compared to the actual or observed values.

A high percentage number. over 70%. is generally a good fir. A low number. below 20 0/0. means that very little of the actual variation is explained by the analysis. Because this initial study had to rely on a database constructed after the fact. lack of data points and high variation in the data that was gathered meant that the statistical fit was poor for several of the projects analyzed.

However, since Case 2 looks only at the view shed and since the resulrs of the Case 2 analysis are completely consistent with the other Cases, the selection of the compa rable community will nor be crucial ro the legitimacy of the overall conclusion. To take another example, Case 1 uses data from the entire time period, both before and after the on-line date. We anticipate possible criticisms of this Case as masking the \"pure\" effect of the development that would only occur after the project came on-line. However, Cases 2 and 3 look separately at the before and after time periods and produce results basically identical ro the Case 1 results. Because all three Cases produce similar results, Cases 2 and 3 answer the concerns about Case 1.\n",
      "THE DATABASE\n",
      "The results of the analysis depend greatly upon the quality of the database that supports the anal ysis. The Report is based on a detailed empirical investigation into the effects of wind development on property values. The study first identified the 27 wind projects over 10 MW installed capacity that have come on-line since 1998. REPP chose the 1998 on-line date as a selection criterion for the database because it represented projects that used the new generation of wind machines that are both taller and quieter than earlier generations. (REPP did not consider projects that came on-line in 2002 or after since there would be too little data on property values after the on- line date to support an analysis. These projects can be added to the overall database and used for subsequent updates of this analysis, however.) REPP chose the 10 MW installed capacity as the other criterion because if the presence of wind turbines is having a negative affect it, should be more pronounced in projects with a large rather than small number of installations. In addition, we used the 10 MW cut-off to assure that the sample of projects did not include an over-weighting of projects using a small number of turbines.\n",
      "Of the 27 projects that came on-line in 1998 or after and that were 10MW or larger installed capacity, for a variety of reasons, 17 had insufficient data to pursue any statistical analysis. For six of the 17 projects we acquired the data, but determined that there were too few sales to support a statistical analysis. For two of the remaining 11, state law prohibited release of property sales infor mation. The remaining nine projects had a combination of factors such as low sales, no electronic data, and paper data available only in the office. (For a project-by-project explanation, see Chapter 2 of the Reporr.)\n",
      "For each of the remaining ten projects, we assembled a database covering roughly a six-year period from 1996 ro the present. For each of these projects we obtained individual records of all property sales in the \"view shed\" of the development for this six-year period. We also constructed a similar database for a \"comparable community\" that is a reasonably close community with similar demographic characteristics. For each of the projects, we selected the comparable community on the basis of the demographics of the community and after discussing the appropriateness of the community with local property assessors. As shown in Table 3 below, the database of view shed and comparable sales included more than 25,000 individual property sales. The initial included database of view shed and comparable sales included over 25,000 individual property sales. After review and culling, the final data set includes over 24,300 individual property sales, as shown in Table,) below.\n",

      "The results of this analysis of property sales in the vicinity of the post-1998 projects suggest that there is no support for the claim that wind development will harm property values. The data represents the experience up to a point in time. The database will change as new projects come on line and as more data becomes available for the sites already analyzed. In order to make the results obtained from this initial analysis as useful as possible to siting authorities and others interested in and involved with wind development, it will be important to maintain and update this database and to add newer projects as they come on-line.\n",
      "Gathering data on property sales after the fact is difficult at best. We recommend that the database and analysis be maintained, expanded and updated on a regular basis. This would entail regularly updating property sales for the projects already analyzed and adding new projects when they cross a predetermined threshold, for example financial closing. In this way the results and conclusions of this analysis can be regularly and quickly updated.\n",

      "BASELINE AND MONITORING STUDIES FOR WIND PROJECTS\n",
      "PRE-PROJECT ASSESSMENT The primary purposes of pre-project assessment studies are to I) collect information suitable for predicting the potential impacts of the project on wildlife and plants and 2) design the project layout (e.g\" turbine locations) so that impacts on biological resources are avoided and minimized. To the extent possible, this pre-project assessment may utilize existing information from projects in comparable habitat types in locations close to the proposed project. The site-specific components and the duration of the assessment should depend on the size of the project, the availability and extent of existing and applicable information in the vicinity of the project, the habitats potentially affected, the likelihood and timing of occurrence of Threatened and Endangered and other Sensitive Status species at the site, and other factors such as issues and concerns identified during public scoping. Each component is discussed below. The results of the information review and baseline studies should be reported to the affected stakeholders (e.g., state and federal wildlife agencies) in a timely fashion.\n",
      "Information Review Existing information on species and potential habitats in the vicinity of the project area should be reviewed and if appropriate, mapped. Sources of existing information should include resource agencies, local experts, recognized databases (e.g., Priority Habitats and Species [PHS] database), and data gathered at other nearby wind plants or other types of projects. This information should be used to develop a current state-of-the-art field and analysis protocol that is reviewed and approved by the state wildlife agency.\n",
      "Habitat Mapping Key information about general vegetation and land cover types, wildlife habitat, habitat qual ity, extent of noxious weeds, and physical characteristics with in the project area should be collected and compiled using current state-of-the-art protocols.\n",
      "Raptor Nest Surveys At a minimum, one raptor nest survey during breeding season within I-mile of the project site ' should be conducted to determine the location and species of active nests potentially disturbed by construction activities, and to identify active and potentially active nest sites with the highest likelihood of impacts from the operation of the wind plant. A larger survey area (e.g., a 2-mile butTer) is recommended if there is some likelihood of the\n",

      "1\n",
      "occurrence of nesting state and/or federally threatened and endangered raptor species (e.g., ferruginous hawk, bald eagle, golden eagle), or if empirical data on displacement impacts may be monitored after construction (see Research-Orientated Studies Below).\n",
      "General Avian Use Surveys A minimum of one full season of avian use surveys is recommended following current state-of-the-art protocols to estimate the use of the project area by avian species/groups of interest during the season of most concern (usually spring/early summer). Additional seasonal data (e.g. fall or winter) is recommended in the following cases: I) use of the site for the avian groups of concern is estimated to be high relative to other projects, 2) there is very little existing data regarding seasonal use of the project site, and/or 3) the project is especially large. This additional avian use data should be collected to refine impact predictions and make decisions on project layout.\n",
      "Surveys for Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive Species If existing information suggests the probable occurrence of state and/or federal threatened or endangered or sensitive-status species on the project site at a level of concern, focused surveys are recommended during the appropriate season to determine the presence or likelihood of presence of the species. For example, if bald eagles are expected to winter in concentrations in the project vicinity, targeted surveys to estimate bald eagle use of the site would be appropriate.\n",
      "MINIMIZATION OF WILDLIFE IMPACTS One goal of the pre-project assessment is to help design the project to avoid, reduce and minimize impacts to habitat and wildlife. Below are some considerations for avoiding and minimizing impacts to wildlife.\n",
      "Avoid Impacts\n",
      "\n",
      "Encourage development in agricultural and already disturbed lands, including using existing transmission corridors and roads where possible.\n",
      "Use of tubular towers is recommended to reduce the ability of birds to perch on towers and to possibly reduce the risk of collision. Discourage the use of lattice towers, particularly those with horizontal cross-members.\n",
      "Discourage tower types that employ guy wires. If guy wired towers are approved, encourage the requirement of bird flight diverters on the guy wires.\n",
      "Avoid high bird concentration areas, especially concentration areas of sensitive status species, and breeding sites.\n",
      "Discourage the use of rodenticides to control rodent burrowing around towers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encourage the protection of PHS priority habitats.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Minimize Impacts\n",
      "Minimize use of overhead power lines. 2\n",
      "When overhead lines are used, use designs that avoid and minimize impacts to raptors and other birds (e.g., adequate conductor spacing, use of perch guards).\n",
      "Minimize the use of lights on towers, in accordance with federal, state, and local requirements, wherever possible because they may attract flying wildlife to the vicinity of the turbines in certain conditions.\n",
      "Encourage the control of noxious weeds in accordance with federal, state, and local laws. Encourage the control of detrimental weedy species that invade existing habitat as a result of disturbance from construction and operation.\n",
      "Encourage the requirement of a complete road siting and management plan, including vehicle-driving speeds that minimize wildlife mortality.\n",
      "Encourage the requirement of a fire protection plan.\n",
      "Reduce or Eliminate Impacts Over Time\n",
      "Encourage a decommissioning condition that would require removal of the turbines and infrastructure when it ceases operation, and restoration of the site to approximate pre-project conditions.\n",
      "OPERATIONAL MONITORING As is the case with most development, some mortality of bats and birds is expected to result from wind power projects. However, it is anticipated that significant impacts to wildlife can be avoided or lessened at most wind projects if proper pre-project assessment is implemented and good project design and management practices are established. Monitoring studies, such as carcass surveys, using current state-of-the-art protocols are required to determine the actual direct impacts of the wind farm on birds. The duration and scope of the monitoring should depend on the size of the project, and the availability of existing monitoring data at projects in comparable habitat types.\n",
      "A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is recommended to be responsible for reviewing results of monitoring data and making suggestions to the perm itting agency regarding the need to adjust mitigation and monitoring requirements based on results of initial monitoring data and available data from other projects. The range of possible adjustments to the monitoring and mitigation requirements should be clearly stated in the project permit (e.g .. Conditional Use Permit). Adjustments should be made if unanticipated impacts become apparent from monitoring data. Examples of such changes\n",
      "2 However. use of overhead power lines might be warranted if habitat type is of concern.\n",
      "3\n",
      "may include additional monitoring or research focused to understand the identified impacts (e.g., bats) and creation of raptor nesting structures (artificial or natural. on or off-site) if significant impacts to raptor species are identified. Adjustments that are not feasible because they would make the wind project un-financeable include removing turbines or shutting down turbines during certain periods of the year. Adjustments can also reduce monitoring requirements based on monitoring data and site-specific conditions.\n",
      "Potential members to the TAC include stakeholders such as state and federal wildlife agencies, the developers, environmental groups, landowners, and county representatives. Protocols for conducting the monitoring study and procedures for reporting and handling, and rehabilitating injured wildlife should be reviewed by the TAC. Progress reports summarizing the monitoring results should be reported to the TAC on a quarterly basis. Reporting schedules and scope of reports will be developed in the event of unusual unanticipated avian mortality.\n",
      "RESEARCH-ORIENTED STUDIES Standard pre-project assessment studies and standard fatality operational monitoring have been distinguished from more research-orientated studies. At some projects, additional studies that utilize pre-construction data may be conducted to test specific research hypotheses about impacts to a particular species or group of species. Rather than being necessary for pre-permit assessment, such studies are often more research-oriented and often are focused on indirect impacts, such as displacement, that provide information for future projects. Examples include the use of gradient analysis in understanding the level of displacement of grassland nesting birds as a function of distance from turbines or raptor nest monitoring comparing density and nest success before and after operation of the wind plant. If such studies are determined to be important to the overall understanding of wind energy/wildlife interactions, they should be designed to follow appropriate experimental designs and state of the art protocols (Anderson et al. 1999, Morrison et al. 2002). Funding for these more research- oriented studies should be solicited from multiple sources, including the wind industry, environmental groups, state and federal agencies, advocacy groups and other sources.\n",

Rationale: There is no net loss of habitat function or value where the replacement habitat would be lost but for its acquisition as mitigation.

      "INTRODUCTION: This pilot program offers an alternative to conventional mitigation for wind projects that can greatly improve the habitat value per mitigation dollar as well as provide a more streamlined and efficient mitigation process for applicants. A significant feature of the pilot program is that it links targeted acquisition by WDFW of the highest value habitat in central and eastern Washington) with sustained \"stewardship\" funding from wind projects to restore, manage, and monitor these critical habitat areas. Fortunately, many of the areas that have the highest habitat values are also low cost, providing an outstanding opportunity to maximize the value of mitigation funds.\n",
      "Because the Alternative Mitigation Pilot Program is experimental in nature, the fee will be reviewed annually, and adjusted as necessary, by WDFW to ensure that it is equitable, compared to the conventional mitigation option in Section 2, and provides incentives to encourage significant participation by wind developers. Mitigation Pilot Program will be reviewed and evaluated at the end of five years, along with the other sections of the Wind Power Guidelines.\n",
      "In addition, the Alternative\n",
      "GOAL: The goal of the Wind Power Alternative Mitigation Pilot Program is to provide an optional and streamlined approach to mitigation that results in better habitat value and is more attractive to wind developers than conventional \"on-site\" mitigation.\n",

      "BACKGROUND OF THE WTSG\n",
      "In May 2007, a local citizen's group, Union Neighbors United, called upon its Champaign County, Ohio\n",
      "elected officials to provide a forum from which discussion could be held on issues surrounding proposed\n",
      "wind turbine development in their township. This group of citizens wanted to explore acceptable\n",
      "approaches to wind energy regulation to ensure that wind energy development would have the least\n",
      "amount of impact on the health, safety and welfare of Champaign County residents and its surrounding\n",
      "habitat.\n",
      "In the months that followed, farmers and owners of undeveloped lands solicited their local\n",
      "governmental leaders for equal opportunity to engage in dialogue that would enable them to voice\n",
      "support for wind turbine placement. These groups of citizens felt strongly that this type of renewable\n",
      "resource would provide the prospects of clean energy, jobs and economic development to Champaign\n",
      "County.\n",
      "In September 2007, the Champaign County Prosecutor's Office agreed to facilitate a series of weekly\n",
      "community meetings. Participants would be culled from a balanced set of primary stakeholders for the\n",
      "purpose of sharing information, exchanging ideas and exploring areas of mutual agreement regarding\n",
      "the potential placement of wind turbines in Champaign County.\n",
      "The result was the formation of the Champaign County Wind Turbine Study Group (WTSG). Champaign\n",
      "County Prosecutor Nick A. Selvaggio solicited named representatives from Champaign County Farm\n",
      "Bureau, Champaign County Township Trustees Association, Everpower Renewables Corp.,\n",
      "logan-Union\n",
      "Champaign Regional Planning Commission, and Union Neighbors United to critically debate the merits\n",
      "and consequences of wind energy development in Champaign County. Although participation in the\n",
      "discussions would be limited to named WTSG members, the WTSG felt that by having its meetings open\n",
      "to the public, it would guarantee transparent access to materials studied and viewpoints debated.\n",
      "For twenty-four weeks, members of the WTSG were given the opportunity to present research materials\n",
      "from a previously developed list of agreed upon topics. Upon the completion of one presentation, the\n",
      "other stakeholders were given the opportunity to present similar or alternative viewpoints and materials\n",
      "on the same topic. Meeting notes were taken and a compilation of materials presented were retained\n",
      "for bibliographical reference and possible future use.\n",
      "MISSION OF THE WTSG\n",
      "The stated mission of the WTSG was \"to inform the decision-makers.\" Specifically, the WTSG wanted to\n",
      "acquire, organize and assess relevant topical information on a variety of wind energy issues. Using the\n",
      "acquired resources, the WTSG would seek to provide input and formulate recommendations to local\n",
      "ii\n",
      "decision-makers who might be considering a governmental response to potential wind energy\n",
      "development in their region of Champaign County.\n",
      "WTSG members were mindful that Ohio law places governing responsibility for electrical generation\n",
      "projects over 50 megawatts on the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) and its Power Siting\n",
      "Board. WTSG members considered whether their informational gathering role should result in\n",
      "formulating regulatory guidelines to local leaders. WTSG members decided that they would not draft\n",
      "model ordinances for local governments to consider. Instead, the WTSG chose to develop a report based\n",
      "on informational assessments and recommendations of multiple issues related to wind energy\n",
      "development.\n",
      "The WTSG was not created by Ohio statutory law. The WTSG has no formal or statutory rule-making\n",
      "authority. The WTSG is comprised of an informal group of concerned community stakeholders that were\n",
      "assembled to study the merits of wind energy development. But for WTSG industry representatives, the\n",
      "members of the WTSG have no specialized knowledge or training in wind energy development. Thus,\n",
      "this document is limited in its ability to be an authoritative guideline on wind energy development due\n",
      "to the educational limitations of its membership.\n",
      "Yet, WTSG members were vigilant in acquiring information from a variety of sources. They discovered an\n",
      "overwhelming amount of information available from government agencies, private companies,\n",
      "consultants and organizations from proponents and opponents of wind energy. In addition, news\n",
      "articles and anecdotal stories were found available for review. The materials collected by the WTSG are\n",
      "available in total and can be assessed, with the report, at the Champaign County Public Library.\n",
      "For every document discovered, there were many others not retrieved for review. As such, any cited\n",
      "materials herein should not be considered to be an exhaustive list of available resources. To the extent\n",
      "that readers of this document wish to consider additional information to assess and weigh the credibility\n",
      "of the information and conclusions set forth in this report, readers are cautioned to consider relevant\n",
      "research and data from qualified experts.\n",
      "In addition to reviewing this document and reading other materials, the WTSG encourages local\n",
      "decision-makers studying wind energy development to visit operating wind farms and consult with other\n",
      "local officials who have previously studied similar issues in their own communities.\n",
      "FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WTSG\n",
      "The findings and recommendations of the WTSG are topically organized as follows:\n",
      "The WTSG studied fourteen (14) different wind energy development topics: Aesthetics, Blade Throw,\n",
      "Decommissioning, Economics, Environmental Impacts, FAA Lighting, Fire/Emergency Response, Ice\n",

      "was allocated to a topic simply based on the resulting \"page length differentiaL\" The WTSG considers\n",
      "each topic equally important to forming a healthy, safe, efficient and economically viable wind energy\n",
      "development plan for our community. Instead, the WTSG trusts that the reader will recognize that a\n",
      "topic's resulting page length was attributable to the WTSG's finding that certain topics merited more\n",
      "vigorous debate based on the nature and content of the material available for review and analysis.\n",
      "For each topic covered, the WTSG defines the problem or issue involved. A summary assessment of the\n",
      "information presented is then provided. The WTSG concludes a review of the topic by offering\n",
      "recommendations for the decision-maker on how to mitigate any potential adverse impact that the\n",
      "particular problem may have on the local community. Where the WTSG failed to reach unanimity on a\n",
      "particular subject, the alternative viewpoint(s) were provided for the reader's consideration.\n",
      "A complete bibliography of information as chronologically presented to and considered by the WTSG is\n",
      "included in the appendix.\n",
      "In summary, consideration should be given to balancing the positive and negative impacts of wind\n",
      "energy on host properties, nonparticipating properties, and the overall community. Decision-makers\n",
      "should take into account cumulative impacts of wind energy projects in the context of other\n",

      "Definition of Issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "Aesthetics has been raised as a concern about wind-energy projects. While some people think turbines are pleasing to view, others likely will not agree. Taking care to place the turbines in a manner that takes aesthetics into account will help the project fit more harmoniously with the community.\n",
      "Information Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of reasons why proposed wind-energy projects evoke aesthetic concerns. Modern wind turbines are relatively new to the United States. Some of the early projects were built in remote areas, but increasingly they are being built in or proposed for areas that are close to residential and recreational uses, and often in areas never before considered for wind power uses. The turbines are often taller than any local zoning ordinance, and they are impossible to screen from view. The movement of the blades makes it more likely that they will draw attention. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 143.\n",
      "One commentator suggests that communities with a rural setting and a history of farming might accept harvesting of wind energy as an acceptable use of their land. Ben Hoen, Impacts of Windmill Visibility on Property Values in Madison County, NY (April 2006) (attached as Appendix B to Faulkner, David, Community Improvement Corporation of Champaign County, \"Economic Impact Study of Wind Farm Development in Champaign County, Ohio\", November 13, 2007).\n",
      "Recommended Action:\n",
      "\n",
      "Local decision-makers should require an aesthetic impact study as part of local jurisdictions' siting and compliance review process. One option for an aesthetic impact study is to require wind developers to provide a visual simulation that depicts how the project would look from different vantage points throughout the project area. The study should specifically address sensitive areas around the project as defined by the local jurisdiction and taking into account, among other things, the policies and designations of the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO).\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Research Council publication, Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects (2007), contains an extensive discussion of how aesthetic impacts can be evaluated in connection with the implementation of projects. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 173-78, 360-75. This publication may be purchased or accessed online at http://www.nap.edu. Follow the \"Energy and Energy Conservation\" link.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aesthetic impacts can be mitigated by ensuring the project has visual order and uniformity, using turbines and towers of consistent height and design, requiring removal of non-operating structures (as appropriately defined), minimizing the visibility of transmission lines and ancillary\n",
      "1\n",
      "structures, minimizing erosion during project construction and operation, requiring turbines to be painted white or grey, and prohibiting turbine use for telecommunication antennas, billboards, and signs.

      "\n",
      "Utilizing the above considerations, in combination with setbacks as warranted, can result in a wind project that is compatible with most existing land uses.\n",
      "o Some, but not all, of the members of the WTSG agree with Paul Gipe that most existing land uses include rural residential, row crops, grazing, commercial, schools, religious sites, some parks, outdoor recreation, tourism, cycling, walking and jogging. Paul Gipe Ag Workshop Powerpoint, Community Wind.\n",
      "Members of the WTSG believe that the following questions could help evaluate the potential for undue cumulative aesthetic impacts associated with new wind turbine projects or expansions of existing wind turbine projects. (All of the following considerations are from National Research Council, \"Environmentallmpaets of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 150-51.)\n",
      "o Are the turbines at a scale appropriate to the landscape?\n",
      "o Are turbine types and sizes uniform within the area?\n",
      "o How great is the offsite visibility of infrastructure (for example, substations and\n",
      "transmission lines)?\n",
      "o Have areas that are inappropriate for wind projects (due to terrain, important scenic,\n",
      "cultural, or recreational values) been identified and evaluated?\n",

      "o\n",
      "Lightning strike does not often lead to detachment of blade fragments. Lightning protection systems have developed significantly over the past decade, leading to a significant reduction in structural damage attributable to lightning strikes;\n",

      "According to GE Energy:\n",
      "\n",
      "The mode of failure of a wind turbine due to an extreme wind event cannot be generalized and depends on the turbine type and configuration, as well as the specifics of the extreme wind event and site conditions. Examples of possible failure scenarios include blade failure or a tower buckling or overturning. When winds are above the cut-out speed, the wind turbine should have its blades idling in a position creating minimal torque on the rotor. This is the only safety mechanism other than the yaw control. If a grid failure were to occur in conjunction with an extreme wind event-which is a likely scenario-the yaw control will become inactive. The loss of yaw control could increase the likelihood of damage/failure in the case of an extreme wind event. Also, the grid components/structures could also be part of the potential wind borne debris. At this time, GE has no modeling capability in place that can predict the impact made to a wind plant if an extreme wind event occurs. Ubarana,\n",

      "Recommended Action:\n",
      "Members ofthe Study Group had differing views as to the degree of setback that is warranted\n",
      "to protect against blade throw.\n",
      "o Some WTSG members are of the view that the precautions and setbacks employed for protection against ice throw (that is, 1.5 x (hub height + blade diameter) from occupied structures, roads and public use areas) are also adequate to protect against blade failure. This view is based on risk-based calculations done for icing situations which consider the frequency of occurrence and the potential travel distance. Wahl, David & Giguere, Philippe, General Electric Energy, \"Ice Shedding and Ice Throw - Risk and Mitigation\", April 2006. Using the recommended setback for ice is appropriate because the physics of anything breaking off the blades, including the blades themselves, is similar. Matilsky, Terry, Rutgers University, \"Part 1- Basic Kinematics\" at p. 1.\n",
      "o Other WTSG members are of the view that a minimum setback of 1,680 feet is\n",
      "warranted based on the potential for broken blades to be thrown that distance. To protect safety and property on adjacent property, these members also believe that this setback should be measured from the adjacent property line.\n",

      "Definition of Issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "Shadow flicker describes the effect caused by wind turbine blades passing between the sun and an observer. Rotation of turbine blades in sunny conditions results in moving shadows on the ground, which results in alternating changes in light intensity. Shadow flicker is different from a related strobe-like phenomenon that is caused by intermittent chopping of the sunlight behind the rotating blades. Shadow flicker is a function of several factors, including the location of people relative to the turbine, the wind speed and direction, the diurnal variation of sunlight, the geographic latitude of the location, the local topography, and the presence of any obstructions. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 160. Shadow flicker is also a function of tower height and rotor diameter.\n",
      "Information Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the National Research Council, shadow flicker is not important at distant sites (for example, greater than 1,000 feet from a turbine) except during the morning and evening when shadows are long. However, sunlight intensity is also lower during the morning and evening when shadows are long. This tends to reduce the effects of shadows and shadow flicker. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 160.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turbines on elevated ridges may cast very long shadows into the adjacent valleys. For example, for a 700' high north-south ridgeline and a 262 foot nacelle, the 300' diameter rotors will cast over a two-mile shadow when the sun is at 5 degrees. Bolton, R.H., \"Evaluation of Environmental Shadow Flicker, Analysis for 'Dutch Hill Wind Power Project\", January 30, 2007 at p.9. Although 700' ridgelines are not representative of topography in Champaign County, Ohio, this example illustrates how topography can affect the length of shadows cast by wind turbines. The length of the shadow and potential exposure to shadow flicker should be calculated based on local topography.\n",
      "o Some, but not all, WTSG members believe that since elevation changes in Champaign County, Ohio, are roughly 200' with much more gradual slopes than those used in the calculations referenced in the Bolton example above, the above example does not provide an accurate representation of potential impacts in Champaign County, Ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the National Research Council, while shadow flicker can be a nuisance to people living near a wind-energy project, in the United States shadow flicker has not been identified as causing even a mild annoyance. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 160.\n",

      "According to one publication, people and animals (for example, dairy cattle) directly under the shadow flicker cast by a bright sun will both be highly affected by shadow flicker from wind turbines by the rapid dimming and brightening. This has not been experienced by most people or livestock ever before and will be a completely new phenomenon.

These members are not aware of any evidence of negative impact to livestock associated with shadow flicker from wind turbines around the world. Other than the report referenced above, according to Mr. Bolton's statement of experience, his experience in wind industry is limited to one analysis of wind turbine noise of unknown content or influence. The report referenced above is an evaluation of shadow flicker assessment made by another firm.\n",

Mr. Bolton has prepared evaluations concerning at least two wind power facilities.

      "To the WTSG's knowledge, there are no u.s. or global uniform standards for mitigation of In Denmark, it is generally recommended that there be no more than 10 hours shadow flicker. per year when shadow flicker is experienced. One wind-energy project in Germany is subject to a restriction of 30 hours per year of shadow flicker on a neighbor's property; that restriction pertains to hours when the neighboring residents are present and awake.

The NRC publication does not specify the underlying assumptions and methodologies used in the Denmark and Germany examples cited above.\n",
      "It is sometimes difficult to work in a dwelling if there is shadow flicker on a window. Even in the worst situations, shadow flicker only lasts for a short time each day, rarely more than a half hour. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 161.\n",
      "o Some, but not all, WTSG members also believe that shadow flicker can be a nuisance\n",
      "outside of a residence, for example, in outdoor recreation contexts.\n",
      "If a turbine is close to a highway, the movement of the large rotor blades and possible resulting shadow flicker can also distract motorists. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 161. A recent compilation of wind industry related accidents reports that three fatalities have been attributed to driver distraction on a circular\n",
      "29\n",
      "road in Germany where turbines become visible to drivers. Craig, David, Wind Turbine Accident Compilation (enclosed in 12/11/07 materials compiled by Champaign County Farm Bureau). Because of the potential for driver distraction, Irish guidelines recommend that turbines be set back from roadways at least 300 meters. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 161.\n",
      "o Some, but not all, WTSG members feel that motorists are subject to a number of\n",
      "distractions when driving. There is no evidence that distance of the turbine from the road can increase or decrease the potential for distraction.\n",
      "Recommended Action:\n",
      "\n",
      "Shadow flicker impacts should be mitigated through proper turbine siting. The wind turbine developer should provide an analysis of the potential shadow flicker impacts for the entire project. The analysis should be performed by a qualified professional and should include the use of an accepted software tool specifically designed for shadow flicker calculations. general, shadow flicker models have the ability to consider local weather conditions, tree cover, and other factors that can determine potential exposure to shadow flicker. These models can also calculate maximum possible exposure given full sunlight without clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local decision-makers should establish reasonable exposure limits for shadow flicker. These exposure limits should be clearly defined, and compliance should be determined during the siting process by use of the software tools referenced above.\n",
      "o Some, but not all, WTSG members believe that there is minimal potential for shadow flicker impact and it is limited to residences. Therefore, any limits for shadow flicker should be calculated based on real exposure to residences. Any calculation of exposure time should take into account scientific data and base calculations on our specific area and latitude of Champaign County, Ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some, but not all, WTSG members recommend that to mitigate potential nuisance to people and animals and adverse property value impacts on adjacent property, any restriction on shadow flicker impacts should be measured from boundaries of adjacent properties. These members recommend that shadow flicker modeling should be based on maximum possible exposure given full sunlight without clouds. These members also recommend that a 10 hourfyear exposure standard, similar to the Danish guideline referenced above, is reasonable and appropriate under any scenario.\n",

      "Wind turbines have the potential to interfere with television, radio, microwave/radio fixed links, cellular phones, and radar transmissions. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 160.\n",
      "Information Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "The main form of interference to TV transmission caused by wind-energy projects is the scattering and reflection of signals by the turbines, mainly the blades. In relation to the components that make up a wind turbine, the tower and nacelle have very little effect on reception (that is, only a small amount of blocking, reflection, and diffraction occurs.) National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 170.\n",
      "\n",
      "Available literature indicates that the effects of wind projects on both AM and FM radio transmission signals are considered to be negligible and only apply at very small distances from the turbines (that is, within tens of meters). National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 171.\n",
      "\n",
      "A wind turbine may degrade the performance of fixed link radio receivers (like satellite dishes), not only if the turbine is within the line of site of the link but also if it is within a certain lateral distance of the link, known as the \"Fresnel zone.\" National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 171.\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for interference of wind turbines with radar is only partially understood. such interference, it would primarily affect military and civilian air-traffic control and National Weather Service weather radar. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 171-72. As of late 2006, the interference of wind turbines with radars is a problem as yet unsolved. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 173.\n",
      "Recommended Action:\n",
      "\n",
      "Local decision-makers should require sufficient information about the potential for telecommunications and radar interference during siting and compliance review of proposed wind-power developments, and should require prompt mitigation of any such interference post installation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Published literature suggests that turbine tower failure is rare, but these accidents do occur. Craig, David, Wind Turbine Accident Compilation.\n",
      "Recommended Action:\n",
      "\n",
      "In connection with pre-construction review and approval of wind power developments, local decision-makers should address this issue with the use of property line, utility line, and roadway setbacks of at least the height of the hub plus the rotor radius. This would ensure that if the turbine structure does fail, it would not damage occupied structures, roadway rights-of-way, or adjacent nonparticipating properties. Also, it would be appropriate to limit access in the immediate area of the wind turbine during testing and inspection procedures. The design and construction of the wind energy project should conform to all applicable industry standards and developer/operator should provide certification of design compliance.\n",

      "Wind Turbine Projects; C.C.Op. 08-006\n",
      "QUESTION PRESENTED\n",
      "The wind turbine study group has asked whether townships have the statutory\n",
      "authority to require \"decommissioning bonding or funding.\" Decommissioning is the act of dismantling and removing a wind turbine at the end of its useful life or when it is deemed unsafe.\n",
      "SHORT ANSWER\n",
      "Since multiple agencies have jurisdiction over the generation and transmission of\n",
      "electrical power, the answer to this question is largely dependent upon who owns or operates the wind turbine or wind farm and its generating capacity.\n",
      "DETAILED ANSWER\n",
      "A township is a creature of statute, possessin{S only the powers it is granted by\n",
      "statute, either expressly or by necessary implication. Thus, a board of township trustees may only exercise the powers expressly conferred by statute and the powers that must necessarily be implied from those express powers to enable the trustees to perform the duties imposed upon them. With that principle in mind, this opinion will briefly discuss several possible scenarios involving the decommissioning of wind turbines and wind farms.\n",
      ": E.g., Hopple v. Trustees ofBrown Township, 13 Ohio St. 311, 324 (1862).\n",
      "Appendix B\n",
      "VlctimIWitness Division Peggy L. Baker Jean A. Erickson\n",
      "Office Administrator Sandi G. Perry\n",
      "a. Public Utilities\n",
      "Revised Code Chapter 519, the statute authorizing townships to enact zoning resolutions, exempts public utilities from its scope. In that regard, R.C. 519.211(A) states:\n",
      "Except as otherwise provided in division (B) or (C) of this section, sections 519.02 to 519.25 of the Revised Code confer no power on any board of township trustees or board of zoning appeals in respect to the location, erection, construction, reconstruction, change, alteration, maintenance, removal, use, or enlargement of any buildings or structures of any public utility or railroad, whether publicly or privately owned, or the use of land by any public utility or railroad, for the operation of its business. 2\n",
      "As this language makes clear, if a wind turbine or wind farm is erected by a public utility, regardless of its generating capacity, it is exempt from township zoning?\n",
      "However, to the extent that a wind turbine or wind farm qualifies as a \"major utility facility,,,4 the Power Siting Board has jurisdiction over its siting. The hearing procedures used by the Power Siting Board allow for public comment, a forum where the decommissioning issue might be raised. With regard to electrical generating facilities that do not qualify as a \"major utility facility,\" the Public Utilities Commission has jurisdiction and its rules might also allow for public comment. Otherwise, it appears that a township can only address the \"decommissioning\" of wind turbines and wind farms owned or operated by public utilities via R.C. 505.86, the general nuisance statute governing unsafe buildings and structures. 5\n",
      "b. Major Utility Facilities\n",
      "If a wind turbine or wind farm is erected by an entity that does not qualify as a\n",
      "public utility, it might still be exempt from township zoning. Revised Code Chapter 4906 sets forth a comprehensive scheme governing the process for applying for and granting\n",
      "2 Division (B) allows townships to regulate teleconununication towers in areas zoned for residential use. Division (C) allows limited regulation over public utilities engaged in the business of transporting personas or property over any public street, road, or highway. Neither division has any application to electric generating and distribution facilities.\n",

      "4 An electric generating facility with a capacity of 50 megawatts or more qualifies as a \"major utility facilIty.\" See R.C. 4906.01(B)(I).\n",
      "5 R.C. 505.86 allows boards of township truStees to provide for the removal, repair, or securance of buildings or other structures that have been declared insecure, unsafe, or structurally defective by any fire department, county building department, or board ofheallh.\n",

      "certificates to construct major utility facilities, including electric generating plants designed for, or capable of, operation at a capacity of 50 megawatts or more. 6\n",
      "More specifically, R.c. 4906.13 provides:\n",
      "No public agency or political subdivision of this state may require any approval, consent, pelmit, certificate, or other condition for the construction or initial operation of a major utility facility authorized by a certificate issued pursuant to [this chapter). ... Nothing herein shall prevent the application of state laws for the protection of employees engaged in the construction of such facility nor of municipal regulations that do not pertain to the location or design of, or pollution control and abatement standards for, a major utility facility for which a certificate has been granted under this chapter.\n",
      "The first sentence of R.C. 4906.13 wholly exempts the siting of major utility facilities from local regulation. 7 The second sentence allows for limited regulation by villages and cities. This sentence makes no provision for townships, however. Therefore, a township has no authority to impose any condition, including the posting of a decommissioning bond or plan, on the construction or initial operation of a major utility facility.\n",
      "It should also be noted that the jurisdiction of the Power Siting Board is not\n",
      "dependent upon whether the \"major utility facility\" is owned or operated by a public utility. In that regard, R.C. 4906.04 provides in part:\n",
      "No person shall commence to construct a major utility facility in this state without first having obtained a certificate for the facility [from the Power Siting Board). ...\n",
      "R.c. 4906.01(A), in tum, defines a \"person\" as \"an individual, corporation, business trust, association, estate, trust, or partnership or any officer, board, commission, department, division, or bureau of the state or a political subdivision of the state, or any other entity.\" This definition of \"person\" includes anyone wishing to construct a major utility facility, without regard to whether they are a public utility.\n",
      "Furthermore, if multiple wind turbines are connected together and enter the grid at\n",
      "a single point, this office believes that their generating capacities should be aggregated, for purposes of determining whether the project qualifies as a \"major utility facility.\" If the aggregate capacity is 50 megawatts or more, a township would have no authority to condition the operation of a wind turbine or wind farm on the posting of a decommissioning bond or plan.\n",

      "Rather, the siting procedure set forth in Revised Code Chapter 4906 and the accompanying administrative rules make provision for public comment. This forum may allow township officials or residents to address the decommissioning issue. Otherwise, it appears that a township's only authority regarding the decommissioning of wind turbines or wind farms with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or more is R.C. 505.86.\n",

      "In that regard, R.C. 519.21(A)\n",
      "Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, sections 519.02 to 519.25 of the Revised Code confer no power on any township zoning commission, board of township trustees, or board of zoning appeals to prohibit the use of any land for agricultural purposes or the construction or use of buildings or structures incident to the use for agricultural purposes of the land on which such buildings or structures are located[.] ...\n",
      "(emphasis added).\n",
      "For purposes ofR.C. 519.21(A), a structure is \"incident to the use for agricultural\n",
      "purposes of the land\" where the structure is directly and immediately related to an agricultural use, or is usually or naturally and inseparably dependent upon an agricultural use. 8 In light of this test, wind turbines that generate electricity that is used for agricultural purposes would appear to be directly and immediately related to an agricultural use, and therefore, exempt from township zoning. If so, a township would have no authority to require the posting of a decommissioning bond or plan as a condition for the wind turbine's erection. Of course, if the wind turbine is abandoned, and therefore no longer used for agricultural purposes, the township would be able to address its removal via the process set forth in R.c. 505.86.\n",
      "d. Non-Major Utility Facilities Owned or Operated by Non-Public Utilities\n",
      "Notwithstanding the broad exemptions provided by Revised Code Chapters 519\n",
      "and 4906 of the Revised Code, some wind turbines and wind farms might still be subject to township zoning. For example, wind turbines and wind farms owned or operated by non-pUblic utilities with a generating capacity under 50 megawatts cannot avail themselves of either the public utility exemption or the major utility facility exemption. Such facilities may be subject to township zoning resolutions. Similarly, small-scale wind turbines intended for personal use might be subject to township zoning.\n",

      "THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of _______, 2022, by and among High Trail Wind Farm, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wind Farm”), McLean County, Illinois (“County”, and together with Wind Farm, sometimes referred to individually as “Party” and collectively as the “Parties”), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Escrow Agent”).\n",
      "WHEREAS, the Parties have entered into that certain Decommissioning Agreement dated [ _], (the “Decommissioning Agreement”);\n",
      "WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed to deposit in escrow within ten (10) business days of the approval of this agreement by the McLean County Board certain funds and wish such deposit to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n",
      "1. herein, and Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein. Appointment. The Parties hereby appoint Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth\n",
      "2. Fund; Investment. (a) Wind Farm agrees to deposit with Escrow Agent the sum of six million dollars ( $ 6,000,000.00) (the “Escrow Deposit”). Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Deposit in one or more demand deposit accounts and shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Deposit and the proceeds thereof (the “Fund”) in an interest bearing demand deposit account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or a successor investment offered by Escrow Agent. Interest bearing demand deposit accounts have rates of compensation that may vary from time to time as determined by Escrow Agent. No other investment of the Escrow Deposit will be permitted during the term of this Agreement. (b) Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of moneys held in the Fund or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any investment described herein, and each Party acknowledges that it was not offered any investment, tax or accounting advice or recommendation by Escrow Agent with regard to any investment and has made an independent assessment of the suitability and appropriateness of any investment selected hereunder for purposes of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of an Authorized Representative of the Parties to give Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Fund. Escrow Agent shall have the right to liquidate any investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make required payments under this Agreement.\n",
      "(c) All interest or other income earned under this Agreement shall be allocated to Wind Farm and reported, by Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing authority, on IRS Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income earned from the Escrow Deposit by Wind Farm whether or not said income has been distributed during such year. Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate in the absence of proper tax documentation or as required by law, and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities. The Parties hereby represent to Escrow Agent that no other tax withholding or information reporting of any kind is required by Escrow Agent.\n",
      "3. Disposition and Termination. (a) Escrow Agent shall release the Fund in accordance with joint written instructions from the relevant Party or Parties in substantially the form of Exhibit A annexed hereto. The Parties agree between themselves that any whole or partial release of the Fund shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Decommissioning Agreement. Escrow Agent shall have no obligation or duty to inquire whether any of the conditions pertaining with the Decommissioning Agreement have occurred or have or have not been satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any instructions in any way related to the transfer or distribution of the Fund must, in order to be deemed delivered and effective, be in writing and executed by the appropriate Party or Parties as evidenced by the signatures of the person or persons signing this Agreement or one of the designated persons as set forth on the Designation of Authorized Representatives attached hereto as Schedule 1-A and 1-B (each an “Authorized Representative”), and delivered to Escrow Agent only by facsimile (as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to the applicable Party’s or Parties’ transmitting fax number) or as a Portable Document Format (“PDF”) attached to an email only at the fax number or email address set forth in Section 8 below or through an online platform offered by Escrow Agent’s escrow services business. Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Fund that does not satisfy the requirements herein. Escrow Agent may rely and act upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be an Authorized Representative in connection with any of Escrow Agent’s verifying callbacks or email confirmations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Escrow Agent (i) shall have no obligation to take any action in connection with this Agreement on a non-Business Day and any action Escrow Agent\n",
      "may otherwise be required to perform on a non-Business Day may be performed by Escrow Agent on the following Business Day and (ii) may not transfer or distribute the Fund until Escrow Agent has completed its security procedures.\n",
      "(b) Each Party authorizes Escrow Agent to use the funds transfer instructions (“Standing Instructions”) specified for it in Schedule 3 attached hereto (as may be supplemented from time to time as described below) to disburse any funds due to such Party, without a verifying callback or email confirmation as set forth below.\n",
      "(c) If any funds transfer instructions other than Standing Instructions are set forth in a permitted instruction from a Party or the Parties in accordance with this Agreement, Escrow Agent may confirm such funds transfer instructions by a telephone callback or email confirmation to an Authorized Representative of such Party or Parties and thereafter, such funds transfer instructions shall also be considered the applicable Party’s Standing Instructions hereunder. To the extent a callback or email confirmation is undertaken, no funds will be disbursed until such confirmation occurs. If multiple disbursements are provided for under this Agreement pursuant to any Standing Instructions, only the date, amount and/or description of payments may change without requiring a telephone callback or email confirmation.\n",
      "(d) The persons designated as Authorized Representatives and telephone numbers and email addresses for same may be changed only in a writing executed by an Authorized Representative or other duly authorized person of the applicable Party setting forth such changes and actually received by Escrow Agent via facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email or through an online platform offered by Escrow Agent’s escrow services business. Escrow Agent may confirm any such change in Authorized Representatives by a telephone callback according to its security procedures.\n",
      "(e) Escrow Agent and other financial institutions, including any intermediary bank and the beneficiary's bank, may rely upon the identifying number of the beneficiary, the beneficiary’s bank or any intermediary bank included in a funds transfer instruction, even if it identifies a person different from the beneficiary, the beneficiary’s bank or intermediary bank identified by name. It is understood that the purpose of Escrow Agent’s security procedures is to verify the authenticity of, and not to detect errors in, instructions.\n",
      "(f) As used in this Agreement, “Business Day” shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which Escrow Agent located at the notice address set forth below is authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed. The Parties acknowledge that the security procedures set forth in this Section 3 are commercially reasonable. Upon delivery of the Fund in full by Escrow Agent, this Agreement shall terminate, and all the related account(s) shall be closed, subject to the provisions of Sections 6 and 7.\n",
      "(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that an electronic signature is affixed to an instruction issued hereunder to disburse or transfer funds, such instruction may be confirmed by a verifying callback (or email confirmation) to an Authorized Representative.\n",
      "4. Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no other duties, including but not limited to any fiduciary duty, shall be implied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Escrow Agent has no knowledge of, nor any obligation to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for determining the meaning of any capitalized term not entirely defined herein, nor shall Escrow Agent be required to determine if any Party has complied with any other agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of any other agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control the actions of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may conclusively rely upon any written notice, document, instruction or request delivered by the Parties believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed by an Authorized Representative(s), as applicable, without inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind and Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. Any notice, document, instruction or request delivered by a Party but not contemplated under this Agreement may be disregarded by Escrow Agent. ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY ACTION TAKEN, SUFFERED OR OMITTED TO BE TAKEN BY IT IN GOOD FAITH EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT ESCROW AGENT'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT WAS THE CAUSE OF ANY DIRECT LOSS TO EITHER PARTY. Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents. In the event Escrow Agent shall be uncertain, or believes there is some ambiguity, as to its duties or rights hereunder or receives instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which in Escrow Agent’s judgment conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, or if Escrow Agent receives conflicting instructions from the Parties, Escrow Agent shall be entitled either to: (a) refrain from taking any action until it shall be given (i) a joint written direction executed by Authorized Representatives of the Parties which eliminates such ambiguity or conflict or (ii) a court order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (it being understood that Escrow Agent shall be entitled conclusively to rely and act upon any such court order and shall have no obligation to determine whether any such court order is final); or (b) file 6\n",

Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving no less than thirty (30) days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the Parties or may be removed, with or without cause, by mutual agreement of the Parties at any time after giving not less than thirty (30) days advance joint written notice to Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent’s sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to hold the Fund (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, appointed by the Parties, or such other person designated by the Parties, or in accordance with the directions of a final court order, at which time of delivery, Escrow Agent’s obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. If prior to the effective resignation or removal date, the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent, or to instruct Escrow Agent to deliver the Fund to another person as provided above, or if such delivery is contrary to applicable law, at any time on or after the effective resignation date, Escrow Agent may either (a) interplead the Fund with a court located in the County of McLean, State of Illinois and the costs, expenses and reasonable attorney’s fees which are incurred in connection with such proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn from the Fund; or (b) appoint a successor escrow agent of its own choice or (c) deliver the Fund to Wind Farm pursuant to Wind Farm’s Standing Instructions. Any appointment of a successor escrow agent shall be binding upon the Parties and no appointed successor escrow agent shall be deemed to be an agent of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall deliver the Fund to any appointed successor escrow agent (or to Wind Farm as described above), at which time Escrow Agent’s obligations under this Agreement shall cease and terminate. Any entity into which Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.\n",
      "6. Compensation; Acknowledgment. Wind Farm shall pay Escrow Agent upon execution of this Agreement and from time to time thereafter reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in writing, shall be as described in Schedule 2. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent any Party deposits funds in excess of the Escrow Deposit as compensation for the Escrow Agent services into an account governed by this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall have the right to withdraw such compensation from such account. Each of the Parties further agrees to the disclosures and agreements set forth in Schedule 2. Indemnification and Reimbursement. The Parties agree jointly and severally to indemnify, defend, hold 7. harmless, pay or reimburse Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (the “Indemnitees”) from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, taxes (other than taxes on income earned by an Indemnitee in connection herewith), costs or expenses (including attorney’s fees) (collectively “Losses”), resulting directly or indirectly from (a) Escrow Agent’s performance of this Agreement, except to the extent that such Losses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bad faith of such Indemnitee; and (b) Escrow Agent’s following, accepting or acting upon any instructions or directions, whether joint or singular, from the Parties received in accordance with this Agreement. The Parties hereby grant Escrow Agent a right of set-off against the Fund for the payment of any claim for indemnification, fees, expenses and amounts due to Escrow Agent or an Indemnitee. The obligations set forth in this Section 7 shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.\n",

Escrow Agent is authorized, for regulatory reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow demand deposit account maintained in the U.S. in which the Fund is held into a non-interest bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest bearing savings internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis between these internal accounts on Escrow Agent’s general ledger in accordance with U.S. law at no cost to the Parties. Escrow Agent will record the internal accounts and any transfers between them on Escrow Agent’s books and records only. The internal accounts and any transfers between them will not affect the Fund, any investment or disposition of the Fund, use of the escrow demand deposit account or any other activities under this Agreement, except as described herein. Escrow Agent will establish a target balance for the demand deposit internal account, which may change at any time. To the extent funds in the demand deposit internal account exceed the target balance, the excess will be transferred to the savings internal account, unless the maximum number of transfers from the savings internal account for that calendar month or statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals from the demand deposit internal account exceeds the available balance in the demand deposit internal account, funds from the savings internal account will be transferred to the demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance of available funds in the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and to replenish any target balance that Escrow Agent has established for the demand deposit internal account. If a sixth transfer is needed during a calendar month or statement cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the savings internal account, and such funds will remain in the demand deposit internal account for the remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.\n",

      "Two wind energy companies have failed to set up agreements with McLean County government to set aside money to protect nearby landowners for wind farm decommissioning, according to County Board Chair John McIntyre.\n",
      "McIntyre announced during Thursday’s monthly county board meeting the states attorney’s office is making “considerable progress” in talks with EDP Renewables and Invenergy to establish escrow accounts.\n",
      "Houston-based EDP started the High Trail Wind Farm and Old Trail Wind Farm, both near Ellsworth, in 2007, along with the more recent Bright Stalk Wind Farm near Chenoa. Chicago-based Invenergy built the White Oak Wind Farm near Carlock which went online in 2011. Invenergy sold that wind farm to White Oak Wind Energy. Invenergy also operates the Blooming Grove Wind Farm in northeast McLean County that started producing energy in 2021, and the company is building the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm near Bellflower.\n",
      "County administrator Cassy Taylor said county staff is working with Invenergy on a decommissioning agreement that is not overdue.\n",
      "McIntyre said the county’s special use permits for the projects require the wind farm companies pay $25,000 per wind tower into an escrow fund to cover any additional costs associated with site restoration once the wind turbines are no longer in use.\n",
      "County officials did not say how much money the companies owed the county. The funds were to be established after 12 years in operation.\n",
      "“McLean County has always been known for honorably fulfilling our end of the contract and we expect all other companies to do likewise,” McIntyre told the board, adding if there’s no resolution by March 16, he will bring the matter back to the board to take action.\n",
      "“It’s time. Enough is enough. We need to get this done,” McIntyre said.\n",
      "Representatives for EDP and Invenergy were not immediately available for comment.\n",
      "In other business, the county board:\n",
      "Approved a preliminary plan by Tom Kirk from Henson Disposal for the HDI subdivision on 44 acres at 2148 Tri Lakes Road in Bloomington Township. Kirk plans to seek permitting for a municipal waste transfer station on the property that already processes construction, demolition and green waste. Kirk said the project is estimated to cost nearly $5 million, adding the station likely will help bring down municipal waste costs for municipalities by offering competition.\n",
      "OK'd a $2.8 million bid from Stark Excavating for the Hoffman Bridge project on Colfax Road (CH 13).\n",
      "Approved a $1.5 million contract with Arthur J. Gallagher Risk Management Services. That marks a 17% increase over the county’s current insurance plan. County staff attribute the increase to less competition in the insurance market, along with inflationary pressures.\n",
      "Adopted an agreement for the McLean County Sheriff’s Office to provide police patrols in the city of Lexington through the end of the year. According to county staff, the Lexington Police Department is reorganizing and needs up to 40 hours of additional coverage. Lexington will pay $85 per hour for deputy patrols.\n",
      "Approved a resolution of congratulations for longtime labor and Democratic Party leader John Penn on his retirement. County Board members gave Penn a standing ovation.\n",

      "CHAPTER I. PROJECT OVERVIEW\n",
      "THE CLAIM AGAlNST WIND DEVELOPMENT\n",
      "Wind energy is the fastest growing domestic energy tesource. Between 1998 and 2002 installed capacity grew from 1848 MW to 4685 MW. a compound growth rate of 26 percent. Since wind energy is now broadly competitive with many traditional generation resources, there is wide expectation that the growth rate of the past five years will continue. (Source for statistics: www.awea.org).\n",
      "As the pace of wind project development has increased, opponents have raised claims in the media and at siting hearings that wind development will lower the value of property within view of the turbines. This is a serious charge that deserves ro be seriously examined.\n",
      "No EXISTING EMPIRICAL SUPPORT\n",
      "As a result of the expansion of capacity from 1998 ro 2002, it is reasonable to expect any nega tive effect would be revealed in an analysis of how already existing projects have affected property values. A search for either European or United States studies on the effect of wind development on property values revealed that no systematic review has as yet been undertaken.\n",
      "As noted above, rhe pace of development and siting hearings is likely to continue, which makes it important to do systematic research in order to establish whether there is any basis for the claims about harm to property values. (For recent press accounts of opposition claims see: The Charleston Gazette, WV, March 30, 2003; and Copley News Service. Ottawa, IL, April 11, 2003).\n",
      "This REPP Analytical Report reviews data on property sales in the vicinity of wind projects and uses statistical analysis to determine whether and the extent to which the presence of a wind power project has had an influence on the prices at which properties have been sold. The hypothesis underlying this analysis is that if wind development can reasonably be claimed to hurt property values. then a careful review of the sales data should show a negative effect on property values within the viewshed of the projects.\n",
      "A SERIOUS CHARGE SERIOUSLY EXAMINED\n",
      "The first step in this analysis required assembling a database covering every wind development that came on-line after 1998 with 10 MW installed capacity or greater. (Note: For this Report we cut off projects that came on-line after 200 I because they would have insufficient data at this time ro allow a reasonable analysis. These projects can be added in future Reports, however.) For the purposes of this analysis, the wind developments were considered to have a visual impact for the area within five miles of the turbines. The five mile threshold was selected because review of the literature and field experience suggests that although wind turbines may be visible beyond five miles, beyond this distance. they do not tend to be highly noticeable. and they have relatively little influence on the landscape's overall character and quality. For a time period covering roughly six years and straddling the on-line date of the projects, we gathered the records for all property sales for the view shed and for a community comparable to the view shed.\n",
      "I! REPI'\n",
      "__________________________ C_HAPTER Or-.:E - EXECUTIV.!' SL;M~~~_Y__\n",
      "For all projects for which we could find sufficient data. we then conducted a statistical analysis ro determine how properC)' values changed over time in the view shed and in the comparable com munity. This database contained more than 25,000 records of properry sales within the view shed Jnd the selected comparable communities.\n",
      "THREE CASE ExAMINATIONS\n",
      "REPP looked at price changes for eJch of the ten projects in thtee ways: Case 1 looked at the chJnges in the view shed and comparable community for the entire period of the study; Case 2 looked at how property values changed in the view shed before and after the project came on-line; Jnd Case 3 looked at how propetty values changed in the view shed and comparable community aftet the project came on-line.\n",
      "Case 1 looked first at how prices changed over the entire period of study for the view shed and comparable region. Where possible, we tried ro colleer data for three years preceding and three years following the on-line date of the project. For the ten projects analyzed, property values increased faster in the view shed in eight of the ten projects. In the rwo projects where the view shed values increased slower than for the comparable community. special circumstances make the tesults questionable. Kern County. California is a site that has had wind development since 1981. Because of the existence of the old wind machines, the site does not provide a look at how the new wind turbines will affect property values. For Fayette County, Pennsylvania the statistical explanation was very poor. For the view shed the statistical analysis could explain only 2 percent of the rotal change in prices.\n",
      "Case 2 compared how prices changed in the view shed before and after the projects came on-line. For the ten projects analyzed, in nine of the ten cases the property values increased faster after the project came on line than they did before. The only project to have slower property value growth after the on-line date was Kewaunee County. Wisconsin. Since Case 2 looks only at the view shed, it is possible that external factors drove up prices faster after the on-line date and that analysis is therefore picking up a facror other than the wind development.\n",
      "Finally, Case 3 looked at how prices changed for both the view shed and the comparable region, but only for the period after the projects came on line. Once again, for nine of the ten projects analyzed, the property values increased faster in the view shed than they did for the comparable commu nity. The only project ro see faster property value increases in the comparable community was Kern County, California. The same caution applied to Case I is necessary in interpreting these results.\n",
      "[f property values had been harmed by being within the view-shed of major wind developments, then we expected that to be shown in a majority of the projecrs analyzed. Instead, ro the contrary. we found that for the great majority of projects the property values actually rose more quickly in [he view shed than they did in the comparable community. Moreover, values increased faster in the view shed after the projects came on-line than they did before.

      "This study is an empirical review of the changes in property values over time and does not attempt to present a model to explain all the influences on property values. The analysis we con ducted was done solely to determine whether the existing data could be interpreted as supporting It would be desitable in future studies the claim that wind development harms property values. to expand the variables incorporated into the analysis and to refine the view shed in order to look at the relationship between property values and the precise distance from development. However, the limitations imposed by gathering data for a consistent analysis of all major developments done post-l998 made those refinements impossible for this study. The statistical analysis of all property sales in the view shed and the comparable community done for this Report provides no evidence that wind development has harmed property values within the view shed. The results from one of the three Cases analyzed are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1 below.\n",
      "REGRESSION ANALYSIS\n",
      "REPP used standard simple statistical regression analyses to determine how property values changed over time in the view shed and the comparable community. In very general terms, a regression analysis \"fits\" a linear relationship, a line. to the available database. The calculated line will have a slope. which in our analysis is the monthly change in average price for the area and time period studied. Once we gathered the data and conducted the regression analysis, we compared the slope of the line for the view shed with the slope of the line for the comparable community (or for the view shed before and after the wind project came on-line).\n",

Because this initial study had to rely on a database constructed after the fact. lack of data points and high variation in the data that was gathered meant that the statistical fit was poor for several of the projects analyzed.

However, since Case 2 looks only at the view shed and since the resulrs of the Case 2 analysis are completely consistent with the other Cases, the selection of the compa rable community will nor be crucial ro the legitimacy of the overall conclusion. To take another example, Case 1 uses data from the entire time period, both before and after the on-line date. We anticipate possible criticisms of this Case as masking the \"pure\" effect of the development that would only occur after the project came on-line. However, Cases 2 and 3 look separately at the before and after time periods and produce results basically identical ro the Case 1 results. Because all three Cases produce similar results, Cases 2 and 3 answer the concerns about Case 1.\n",
      "THE DATABASE\n",
      "The results of the analysis depend greatly upon the quality of the database that supports the anal ysis. The Report is based on a detailed empirical investigation into the effects of wind development on property values. The study first identified the 27 wind projects over 10 MW installed capacity that have come on-line since 1998. REPP chose the 1998 on-line date as a selection criterion for the database because it represented projects that used the new generation of wind machines that are both taller and quieter than earlier generations. (REPP did not consider projects that came on-line in 2002 or after since there would be too little data on property values after the on- line date to support an analysis. These projects can be added to the overall database and used for subsequent updates of this analysis, however.) REPP chose the 10 MW installed capacity as the other criterion because if the presence of wind turbines is having a negative affect it, should be more pronounced in projects with a large rather than small number of installations. In addition, we used the 10 MW cut-off to assure that the sample of projects did not include an over-weighting of projects using a small number of turbines.\n",
      "Of the 27 projects that came on-line in 1998 or after and that were 10MW or larger installed capacity, for a variety of reasons, 17 had insufficient data to pursue any statistical analysis. For six of the 17 projects we acquired the data, but determined that there were too few sales to support a statistical analysis. For two of the remaining 11, state law prohibited release of property sales infor mation. The remaining nine projects had a combination of factors such as low sales, no electronic data, and paper data available only in the office. (For a project-by-project explanation, see Chapter 2 of the Reporr.)\n",
      "For each of the remaining ten projects, we assembled a database covering roughly a six-year period from 1996 ro the present. For each of these projects we obtained individual records of all property sales in the \"view shed\" of the development for this six-year period. We also constructed a similar database for a \"comparable community\" that is a reasonably close community with similar demographic characteristics. For each of the projects, we selected the comparable community on the basis of the demographics of the community and after discussing the appropriateness of the community with local property assessors. As shown in Table 3 below, the database of view shed and comparable sales included more than 25,000 individual property sales. The initial included database of view shed and comparable sales included over 25,000 individual property sales. After review and culling, the final data set includes over 24,300 individual property sales, as shown in Table,) below.\n",

      "RECOMMENDATIONS\n",
      "The results of this analysis of property sales in the vicinity of the post-1998 projects suggest that there is no support for the claim that wind development will harm property values. The data represents the experience up to a point in time. The database will change as new projects come on line and as more data becomes available for the sites already analyzed. In order to make the results obtained from this initial analysis as useful as possible to siting authorities and others interested in and involved with wind development, it will be important to maintain and update this database and to add newer projects as they come on-line.\n",
      "Gathering data on property sales after the fact is difficult at best. We recommend that the database and analysis be maintained, expanded and updated on a regular basis. This would entail regularly updating property sales for the projects already analyzed and adding new projects when they cross a predetermined threshold, for example financial closing. In this way the results and conclusions of this analysis can be regularly and quickly updated.\n",

      "BASELINE AND MONITORING STUDIES FOR WIND PROJECTS\n",
      "PRE-PROJECT ASSESSMENT The primary purposes of pre-project assessment studies are to I) collect information suitable for predicting the potential impacts of the project on wildlife and plants and 2) design the project layout (e.g\" turbine locations) so that impacts on biological resources are avoided and minimized. To the extent possible, this pre-project assessment may utilize existing information from projects in comparable habitat types in locations close to the proposed project. The site-specific components and the duration of the assessment should depend on the size of the project, the availability and extent of existing and applicable information in the vicinity of the project, the habitats potentially affected, the likelihood and timing of occurrence of Threatened and Endangered and other Sensitive Status species at the site, and other factors such as issues and concerns identified during public scoping. Each component is discussed below. The results of the information review and baseline studies should be reported to the affected stakeholders (e.g., state and federal wildlife agencies) in a timely fashion.\n",
      "Information Review Existing information on species and potential habitats in the vicinity of the project area should be reviewed and if appropriate, mapped. Sources of existing information should include resource agencies, local experts, recognized databases (e.g., Priority Habitats and Species [PHS] database), and data gathered at other nearby wind plants or other types of projects. This information should be used to develop a current state-of-the-art field and analysis protocol that is reviewed and approved by the state wildlife agency.\n",
      "Habitat Mapping Key information about general vegetation and land cover types, wildlife habitat, habitat qual ity, extent of noxious weeds, and physical characteristics with in the project area should be collected and compiled using current state-of-the-art protocols.\n",
      "Raptor Nest Surveys At a minimum, one raptor nest survey during breeding season within I-mile of the project site ' should be conducted to determine the location and species of active nests potentially disturbed by construction activities, and to identify active and potentially active nest sites with the highest likelihood of impacts from the operation of the wind plant. A larger survey area (e.g., a 2-mile butTer) is recommended if there is some likelihood of the\n",

      "1\n",
      "occurrence of nesting state and/or federally threatened and endangered raptor species (e.g., ferruginous hawk, bald eagle, golden eagle), or if empirical data on displacement impacts may be monitored after construction (see Research-Orientated Studies Below).\n",
      "General Avian Use Surveys A minimum of one full season of avian use surveys is recommended following current state-of-the-art protocols to estimate the use of the project area by avian species/groups of interest during the season of most concern (usually spring/early summer). Additional seasonal data (e.g. fall or winter) is recommended in the following cases: I) use of the site for the avian groups of concern is estimated to be high relative to other projects, 2) there is very little existing data regarding seasonal use of the project site, and/or 3) the project is especially large. This additional avian use data should be collected to refine impact predictions and make decisions on project layout.\n",
      "Surveys for Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive Species If existing information suggests the probable occurrence of state and/or federal threatened or endangered or sensitive-status species on the project site at a level of concern, focused surveys are recommended during the appropriate season to determine the presence or likelihood of presence of the species. For example, if bald eagles are expected to winter in concentrations in the project vicinity, targeted surveys to estimate bald eagle use of the site would be appropriate.\n",
      "MINIMIZATION OF WILDLIFE IMPACTS One goal of the pre-project assessment is to help design the project to avoid, reduce and minimize impacts to habitat and wildlife. Below are some considerations for avoiding and minimizing impacts to wildlife.\n",
      "Avoid Impacts\n",
      "\n",
      "Encourage development in agricultural and already disturbed lands, including using existing transmission corridors and roads where possible.\n",
      "Use of tubular towers is recommended to reduce the ability of birds to perch on towers and to possibly reduce the risk of collision. Discourage the use of lattice towers, particularly those with horizontal cross-members.\n",
      "Discourage tower types that employ guy wires. If guy wired towers are approved, encourage the requirement of bird flight diverters on the guy wires.\n",
      "Avoid high bird concentration areas, especially concentration areas of sensitive status species, and breeding sites.\n",
      "Discourage the use of rodenticides to control rodent burrowing around towers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encourage the protection of PHS priority habitats.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Minimize Impacts\n",
      "Minimize use of overhead power lines. 2\n",
      "When overhead lines are used, use designs that avoid and minimize impacts to raptors and other birds (e.g., adequate conductor spacing, use of perch guards).\n",
      "Minimize the use of lights on towers, in accordance with federal, state, and local requirements, wherever possible because they may attract flying wildlife to the vicinity of the turbines in certain conditions.\n",
      "Encourage the control of noxious weeds in accordance with federal, state, and local laws. Encourage the control of detrimental weedy species that invade existing habitat as a result of disturbance from construction and operation.\n",
      "Encourage the requirement of a complete road siting and management plan, including vehicle-driving speeds that minimize wildlife mortality.\n",
      "Encourage the requirement of a fire protection plan.\n",
      "Reduce or Eliminate Impacts Over Time\n",
      "Encourage a decommissioning condition that would require removal of the turbines and infrastructure when it ceases operation, and restoration of the site to approximate pre-project conditions.\n",
      "OPERATIONAL MONITORING As is the case with most development, some mortality of bats and birds is expected to result from wind power projects. However, it is anticipated that significant impacts to wildlife can be avoided or lessened at most wind projects if proper pre-project assessment is implemented and good project design and management practices are established. Monitoring studies, such as carcass surveys, using current state-of-the-art protocols are required to determine the actual direct impacts of the wind farm on birds. The duration and scope of the monitoring should depend on the size of the project, and the availability of existing monitoring data at projects in comparable habitat types.\n",
      "A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is recommended to be responsible for reviewing results of monitoring data and making suggestions to the perm itting agency regarding the need to adjust mitigation and monitoring requirements based on results of initial monitoring data and available data from other projects. The range of possible adjustments to the monitoring and mitigation requirements should be clearly stated in the project permit (e.g .. Conditional Use Permit). Adjustments should be made if unanticipated impacts become apparent from monitoring data. Examples of such changes\n",
      "2 However. use of overhead power lines might be warranted if habitat type is of concern.\n",
      "3\n",
      "may include additional monitoring or research focused to understand the identified impacts (e.g., bats) and creation of raptor nesting structures (artificial or natural. on or off-site) if significant impacts to raptor species are identified. Adjustments that are not feasible because they would make the wind project un-financeable include removing turbines or shutting down turbines during certain periods of the year. Adjustments can also reduce monitoring requirements based on monitoring data and site-specific conditions.\n",
      "Potential members to the TAC include stakeholders such as state and federal wildlife agencies, the developers, environmental groups, landowners, and county representatives. Protocols for conducting the monitoring study and procedures for reporting and handling, and rehabilitating injured wildlife should be reviewed by the TAC. Progress reports summarizing the monitoring results should be reported to the TAC on a quarterly basis. Reporting schedules and scope of reports will be developed in the event of unusual unanticipated avian mortality.\n",
      "RESEARCH-ORIENTED STUDIES Standard pre-project assessment studies and standard fatality operational monitoring have been distinguished from more research-orientated studies. At some projects, additional studies that utilize pre-construction data may be conducted to test specific research hypotheses about impacts to a particular species or group of species. Rather than being necessary for pre-permit assessment, such studies are often more research-oriented and often are focused on indirect impacts, such as displacement, that provide information for future projects. Examples include the use of gradient analysis in understanding the level of displacement of grassland nesting birds as a function of distance from turbines or raptor nest monitoring comparing density and nest success before and after operation of the wind plant. If such studies are determined to be important to the overall understanding of wind energy/wildlife interactions, they should be designed to follow appropriate experimental designs and state of the art protocols (Anderson et al. 1999, Morrison et al. 2002). Funding for these more research- oriented studies should be solicited from multiple sources, including the wind industry, environmental groups, state and federal agencies, advocacy groups and other sources.\n",

Rationale: There is no net loss of habitat function or value where the replacement habitat would be lost but for its acquisition as mitigation. In fact, there should be a net gain in habitat value over time since protection of the replacement habitat (of equal or better value than the impacted area) will usually result in improved habitat value.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: This pilot program offers an alternative to conventional mitigation for wind projects that can greatly improve the habitat value per mitigation dollar as well as provide a more streamlined and efficient mitigation process for applicants. A significant feature of the pilot program is that it links targeted acquisition by WDFW of the highest value habitat in central and eastern Washington) with sustained \"stewardship\" funding from wind projects to restore, manage, and monitor these critical habitat areas. Fortunately, many of the areas that have the highest habitat values are also low cost, providing an outstanding opportunity to maximize the value of mitigation funds.\n",
      "Because the Alternative Mitigation Pilot Program is experimental in nature, the fee will be reviewed annually, and adjusted as necessary, by WDFW to ensure that it is equitable, compared to the conventional mitigation option in Section 2, and provides incentives to encourage significant participation by wind developers. Mitigation Pilot Program will be reviewed and evaluated at the end of five years, along with the other sections of the Wind Power Guidelines.\n",
      "In addition, the Alternative\n",
      "GOAL: The goal of the Wind Power Alternative Mitigation Pilot Program is to provide an optional and streamlined approach to mitigation that results in better habitat value and is more attractive to wind developers than conventional \"on-site\" mitigation.\n",
      "PRE-PROJECT ASSESSMENT, OPERATIONAL MONITORING A wind project applicant may either:\n",
      "I. Follow the guidance set forth in Section I of the Wind Power Guidelines document\n",
      "(Baseline and Monitoring Studies for Wind Projects), or\n",
      "2. Follow a streamlined process (to be negotiated with WDFW) if the project is to be sited in an area that has been determined by WDFW to present a low probability of significant risk to wildlife (and efforts have been made to avoid and minimize wildlife impacts).\n",
      "ALTERNATIVE HABITAT MITIGATION After determination by the wind project applicant, in consultation with WDFW, of the project's impact on habitat (in terms of acres permanently and temporarily impacted, and the type and general quality of habitat impacted), the applicant and WDFW will identify the appropriate annual fee for the life of the project4 , based on an Alternative Mitigation Fee Rate of$55.00/acre/year for each acre of replacement habitat that would be owed\n",
      "1 At the time of this writing, a request is being made to the State Legislature for an appropriation in the 2004 Supplemental Operating Budget. • \"Life of the project\" is defined as beginning at the end of the first year of commercial operation and cnding with implementation of the project decommissioning plan.\n",
      "9\n",
      "using the ratios and analysis contained in Section 2. 5\n",
      "As noted above, the Alternative Mitigation Fee Rate will be reviewed annually, and adjusted as necessary, by WOFW. Changes to the fee will be applied to future wind development proposals (for which mitigation has not yet been determined); changes in the fee will not be applied retroactively.\n",
      "General provisions:\n",
      "\n",
      "The fee listed above is based on habitat in \"average\" condition and can be increased or decreased by up to 25% to account for differences in habitat quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The applicant will be required to implement an approved restoration plan for temporarily impacted areas (in accordance with Section 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where the project impacts a mixture of habitat types, the fee schedule will be applied accordingly (to the nearest acre).\n",
      "\n",
      "The annual fee will be used primarily to support \"stewardship\" of high-value habitat in the same ecological region as the project (for management, monitoring, restoration, It is envisioned that these annual stewardship funds protection from degradation). will be applied to strategically important habitat in central and eastern Washington that is newly acquired by WOFW. The annual fees will be deposited into a dedicated WOFW account and may also be used for acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the applicant and WOFW cannot agree on a mutually advantageous \"package\" under the alternative mitigation program, the conventional mitigation guidance in Section 2 will be applied to the project.\n",
      "j To determine Alternative Mitigation Fee, use the guidance provided in Section 2 to:\n",
      "I) Determine acres permanently and temporarily impacted by project for the shrub-steppe and grass\n",
      "categories (i.e., permanently impacted shrub-steppe, permanently impacted grassieR?, temporarily impacted shrub-steppe, and temporarily impacted grassieR?);\n",

      "BACKGROUND OF THE WTSG\n",
      "In May 2007, a local citizen's group, Union Neighbors United, called upon its Champaign County, Ohio\n",
      "elected officials to provide a forum from which discussion could be held on issues surrounding proposed\n",
      "wind turbine development in their township. This group of citizens wanted to explore acceptable\n",
      "approaches to wind energy regulation to ensure that wind energy development would have the least\n",
      "amount of impact on the health, safety and welfare of Champaign County residents and its surrounding\n",
      "habitat.\n",
      "In the months that followed, farmers and owners of undeveloped lands solicited their local\n",
      "governmental leaders for equal opportunity to engage in dialogue that would enable them to voice\n",
      "support for wind turbine placement. These groups of citizens felt strongly that this type of renewable\n",
      "resource would provide the prospects of clean energy, jobs and economic development to Champaign\n",
      "County.\n",
      "In September 2007, the Champaign County Prosecutor's Office agreed to facilitate a series of weekly\n",
      "community meetings. Participants would be culled from a balanced set of primary stakeholders for the\n",
      "purpose of sharing information, exchanging ideas and exploring areas of mutual agreement regarding\n",
      "the potential placement of wind turbines in Champaign County.\n",
      "The result was the formation of the Champaign County Wind Turbine Study Group (WTSG). Champaign\n",

      "Bureau, Champaign County Township Trustees Association, Everpower Renewables Corp.,\n",
      "logan-Union\n",
      "Champaign Regional Planning Commission, and Union Neighbors United to critically debate the merits\n",
      "and consequences of wind energy development in Champaign County. Although participation in the\n",
      "discussions would be limited to named WTSG members, the WTSG felt that by having its meetings open\n",
      "to the public, it would guarantee transparent access to materials studied and viewpoints debated.\n",
      "For twenty-four weeks, members of the WTSG were given the opportunity to present research materials\n",
      "from a previously developed list of agreed upon topics. Upon the completion of one presentation, the\n",
      "other stakeholders were given the opportunity to present similar or alternative viewpoints and materials\n",
      "on the same topic. Meeting notes were taken and a compilation of materials presented were retained\n",
      "for bibliographical reference and possible future use.\n",
      "MISSION OF THE WTSG\n",
      "The stated mission of the WTSG was \"to inform the decision-makers.\" Specifically, the WTSG wanted to\n",
      "acquire, organize and assess relevant topical information on a variety of wind energy issues. Using the\n",
      "acquired resources, the WTSG would seek to provide input and formulate recommendations to local\n",
      "ii\n",
      "decision-makers who might be considering a governmental response to potential wind energy\n",
      "development in their region of Champaign County.\n",
      "WTSG members were mindful that Ohio law places governing responsibility for electrical generation\n",
      "projects over 50 megawatts on the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) and its Power Siting\n",
      "Board. WTSG members considered whether their informational gathering role should result in\n",
      "formulating regulatory guidelines to local leaders. WTSG members decided that they would not draft\n",
      "model ordinances for local governments to consider. Instead, the WTSG chose to develop a report based\n",
      "on informational assessments and recommendations of multiple issues related to wind energy\n",
      "development.\n",
      "The WTSG was not created by Ohio statutory law. The WTSG has no formal or statutory rule-making\n",
      "authority. The WTSG is comprised of an informal group of concerned community stakeholders that were\n",
      "assembled to study the merits of wind energy development. But for WTSG industry representatives, the\n",
      "members of the WTSG have no specialized knowledge or training in wind energy development. Thus,\n",
      "this document is limited in its ability to be an authoritative guideline on wind energy development due\n",
      "to the educational limitations of its membership.\n",
      "Yet, WTSG members were vigilant in acquiring information from a variety of sources. They discovered an\n",
      "overwhelming amount of information available from government agencies, private companies,\n",
      "consultants and organizations from proponents and opponents of wind energy. In addition, news\n",
      "articles and anecdotal stories were found available for review. The materials collected by the WTSG are\n",
      "available in total and can be assessed, with the report, at the Champaign County Public Library.\n",
      "For every document discovered, there were many others not retrieved for review. As such, any cited\n",
      "materials herein should not be considered to be an exhaustive list of available resources. To the extent\n",
      "that readers of this document wish to consider additional information to assess and weigh the credibility\n",
      "of the information and conclusions set forth in this report, readers are cautioned to consider relevant\n",
      "research and data from qualified experts.\n",
      "In addition to reviewing this document and reading other materials, the WTSG encourages local\n",

      "each topic equally important to forming a healthy, safe, efficient and economically viable wind energy\n",
      "development plan for our community. Instead, the WTSG trusts that the reader will recognize that a\n",
      "topic's resulting page length was attributable to the WTSG's finding that certain topics merited more\n",
      "vigorous debate based on the nature and content of the material available for review and analysis.\n",
      "For each topic covered, the WTSG defines the problem or issue involved. A summary assessment of the\n",
      "information presented is then provided. The WTSG concludes a review of the topic by offering\n",
      "recommendations for the decision-maker on how to mitigate any potential adverse impact that the\n",
      "particular problem may have on the local community. Where the WTSG failed to reach unanimity on a\n",

      "A complete bibliography of information as chronologically presented to and considered by the WTSG is\n",
      "included in the appendix.\n",
      "In summary, consideration should be given to balancing the positive and negative impacts of wind\n",
      "energy on host properties, nonparticipating properties, and the overall community. Decision-makers\n",
      "should take into account cumulative impacts of wind energy projects in the context of other\n",

      "Definition of Issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "Aesthetics has been raised as a concern about wind-energy projects. While some people think turbines are pleasing to view, others likely will not agree. Taking care to place the turbines in a manner that takes aesthetics into account will help the project fit more harmoniously with the community.\n",
      "Information Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of reasons why proposed wind-energy projects evoke aesthetic concerns. Modern wind turbines are relatively new to the United States. Some of the early projects were built in remote areas, but increasingly they are being built in or proposed for areas that are close to residential and recreational uses, and often in areas never before considered for wind power uses. The turbines are often taller than any local zoning ordinance, and they are impossible to screen from view. The movement of the blades makes it more likely that they will draw attention. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 143.\n",
      "One commentator suggests that communities with a rural setting and a history of farming might accept harvesting of wind energy as an acceptable use of their land. Ben Hoen, Impacts of Windmill Visibility on Property Values in Madison County, NY (April 2006) (attached as Appendix B to Faulkner, David, Community Improvement Corporation of Champaign County, \"Economic Impact Study of Wind Farm Development in Champaign County, Ohio\", November 13, 2007).\n",
      "Recommended Action:\n",
      "\n",
      "Local decision-makers should require an aesthetic impact study as part of local jurisdictions' siting and compliance review process. One option for an aesthetic impact study is to require wind developers to provide a visual simulation that depicts how the project would look from different vantage points throughout the project area. The study should specifically address sensitive areas around the project as defined by the local jurisdiction and taking into account, among other things, the policies and designations of the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO).\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Research Council publication, Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects (2007), contains an extensive discussion of how aesthetic impacts can be evaluated in connection with the implementation of projects. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 173-78, 360-75. This publication may be purchased or accessed online at http://www.nap.edu. Follow the \"Energy and Energy Conservation\" link.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aesthetic impacts can be mitigated by ensuring the project has visual order and uniformity, using turbines and towers of consistent height and design, requiring removal of non-operating structures (as appropriately defined), minimizing the visibility of transmission lines and ancillary\n",
      "1\n",
      "structures, minimizing erosion during project construction and operation, requiring turbines to be painted white or grey, and prohibiting turbine use for telecommunication antennas, billboards, and signs.

      "\n",
      "Utilizing the above considerations, in combination with setbacks as warranted, can result in a wind project that is compatible with most existing land uses.\n",

      "Members of the WTSG believe that the following questions could help evaluate the potential for undue cumulative aesthetic impacts associated with new wind turbine projects or expansions of existing wind turbine projects. (All of the following considerations are from National Research Council, \"Environmentallmpaets of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 150-51.)\n",
      "o Are the turbines at a scale appropriate to the landscape?\n",
      "o Are turbine types and sizes uniform within the area?\n",
      "o How great is the offsite visibility of infrastructure (for example, substations and\n",
      "transmission lines)?\n",
      "o Have areas that are inappropriate for wind projects (due to terrain, important scenic,\n",
      "cultural, or recreational values) been identified and evaluated?\n",
      "o\n",
      "If the project is built as proposed, would the area retain any undeveloped scenic vistas?\n",

      "\n",
      "The mode of failure of a wind turbine due to an extreme wind event cannot be generalized and depends on the turbine type and configuration, as well as the specifics of the extreme wind event and site conditions. Examples of possible failure scenarios include blade failure or a tower buckling or overturning. When winds are above the cut-out speed, the wind turbine should have its blades idling in a position creating minimal torque on the rotor. This is the only safety mechanism other than the yaw control. If a grid failure were to occur in conjunction with an extreme wind event-which is a likely scenario-the yaw control will become inactive. The loss of yaw control could increase the likelihood of damage/failure in the case of an extreme wind event. Also, the grid components/structures could also be part of the potential wind borne debris. At this time, GE has no modeling capability in place that can predict the impact made to a wind plant if an extreme wind event occurs. Ubarana,\n",

Shadow flicker is different from a related strobe-like phenomenon that is caused by intermittent chopping of the sunlight behind the rotating blades. Shadow flicker is a function of several factors, including the location of people relative to the turbine, the wind speed and direction, the diurnal variation of sunlight, the geographic latitude of the location, the local topography, and the presence of any obstructions.

For example, for a 700' high north-south ridgeline and a 262 foot nacelle, the 300' diameter rotors will cast over a two-mile shadow when the sun is at 5 degrees. Bolton, R.H., \"Evaluation of Environmental Shadow Flicker, Analysis for 'Dutch Hill Wind Power Project\", January 30, 2007 at p.9. Although 700' ridgelines are not representative of topography in Champaign County, Ohio, this example illustrates how topography can affect the length of shadows cast by wind turbines. The length of the shadow and potential exposure to shadow flicker should be calculated based on local topography.\n",

      "According to one publication, people and animals (for example, dairy cattle) directly under the shadow flicker cast by a bright sun will both be highly affected by shadow flicker from wind turbines by the rapid dimming and brightening. This has not been experienced by most people or livestock ever before and will be a completely new phenomenon. Bolton, R.H., \"Evaluation of Environmental Shadow Flicker, Analysis for 'Dutch Hill Wind Power Project\", January 30, 2007 at p.l0.\n",
      "o Some, but not all, WTSG members feel that the Bolton statement above is opinion and not based on science, expertise, or experience. These members are not aware of any evidence of negative impact to livestock associated with shadow flicker from wind turbines around the world. Other than the report referenced above, according to Mr. Bolton's statement of experience, his experience in wind industry is limited to one analysis of wind turbine noise of unknown content or influence. The report referenced above is an evaluation of shadow flicker assessment made by another firm.\n",
      "o Some, but not all, WTSG members note that the author of the Bolton report has at 23 years\n",
      "of professional experience as a project engineer (Eastman Kodak) and physics faculty member (Rochester Institute of Technology). Mr. Bolton has prepared evaluations concerning at least two wind power facilities. Furthermore, these members assert that the determination whether shadow flicker may constitute a nuisance is determined by what a reasonable person would consider an unacceptable impact, and is not solely a scientific matter.\n",
      "To the WTSG's knowledge, there are no u.s. or global uniform standards for mitigation of In Denmark, it is generally recommended that there be no more than 10 hours shadow flicker. per year when shadow flicker is experienced. One wind-energy project in Germany is subject to a restriction of 30 hours per year of shadow flicker on a neighbor's property; that restriction pertains to hours when the neighboring residents are present and awake. National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 161. The NRC publication does not specify the underlying assumptions and methodologies used in the Denmark and Germany examples cited above.\n",
      "It is sometimes difficult to work in a dwelling if there is shadow flicker on a window.

      "Shadow flicker impacts should be mitigated through proper turbine siting. The wind turbine developer should provide an analysis of the potential shadow flicker impacts for the entire project. The analysis should be performed by a qualified professional and should include the use of an accepted software tool specifically designed for shadow flicker calculations. general, shadow flicker models have the ability to consider local weather conditions, tree cover, and other factors that can determine potential exposure to shadow flicker. These models can also calculate maximum possible exposure given full sunlight without clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local decision-makers should establish reasonable exposure limits for shadow flicker. These exposure limits should be clearly defined, and compliance should be determined during the siting process by use of the software tools referenced above.\n",
      "o Some, but not all, WTSG members believe that there is minimal potential for shadow flicker impact and it is limited to residences. Therefore, any limits for shadow flicker should be calculated based on real exposure to residences.

      "Information Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "The main form of interference to TV transmission caused by wind-energy projects is the scattering and reflection of signals by the turbines, mainly the blades. In relation to the components that make up a wind turbine, the tower and nacelle have very little effect on reception (that is, only a small amount of blocking, reflection, and diffraction occurs.) National Research Council, \"Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects\", May 2007 at p. 170.\n",
      "\n",
      "Available literature indicates that the effects of wind projects on both AM and FM radio transmission signals are considered to be negligible and only apply at very small distances from the turbines (that is, within tens of meters).

      "In connection with pre-construction review and approval of wind power developments, local decision-makers should address this issue with the use of property line, utility line, and roadway setbacks of at least the height of the hub plus the rotor radius. This would ensure that if the turbine structure does fail, it would not damage occupied structures, roadway rights-of-way, or adjacent nonparticipating properties. Also, it would be appropriate to limit access in the immediate area of the wind turbine during testing and inspection procedures. The design and construction of the wind energy project should conform to all applicable industry standards and developer/operator should provide certification of design compliance.\n",

      "A township is a creature of statute, possessin{S only the powers it is granted by\n",
      "statute, either expressly or by necessary implication. Thus, a board of township trustees may only exercise the powers expressly conferred by statute and the powers that must necessarily be implied from those express powers to enable the trustees to perform the duties imposed upon them. With that principle in mind, this opinion will briefly discuss several possible scenarios involving the decommissioning of wind turbines and wind farms.\n",

      "Appendix B\n",
      "VlctimIWitness Division Peggy L. Baker Jean A. Erickson\n",
      "Office Administrator Sandi G. Perry\n",
      "a. Public Utilities\n",
      "Revised Code Chapter 519, the statute authorizing townships to enact zoning resolutions, exempts public utilities from its scope. In that regard, R.C. 519.211(A) states:\n",
      "Except as otherwise provided in division (B) or (C) of this section, sections 519.02 to 519.25 of the Revised Code confer no power on any board of township trustees or board of zoning appeals in respect to the location, erection, construction, reconstruction, change, alteration, maintenance, removal, use, or enlargement of any buildings or structures of any public utility or railroad, whether publicly or privately owned, or the use of land by any public utility or railroad, for the operation of its business. 2\n",
      "As this language makes clear, if a wind turbine or wind farm is erected by a public utility, regardless of its generating capacity, it is exempt from township zoning?\n",
      "However, to the extent that a wind turbine or wind farm qualifies as a \"major utility facility,,,4 the Power Siting Board has jurisdiction over its siting. The hearing procedures used by the Power Siting Board allow for public comment, a forum where the decommissioning issue might be raised. With regard to electrical generating facilities that do not qualify as a \"major utility facility,\" the Public Utilities Commission has jurisdiction and its rules might also allow for public comment. Otherwise, it appears that a township can only address the \"decommissioning\" of wind turbines and wind farms owned or operated by public utilities via R.C. 505.86, the general nuisance statute governing unsafe buildings and structures. 5\n",
      "b. Major Utility Facilities\n",
      "If a wind turbine or wind farm is erected by an entity that does not qualify as a\n",
      "public utility, it might still be exempt from township zoning. Revised Code Chapter 4906 sets forth a comprehensive scheme governing the process for applying for and granting\n",
      "2 Division (B) allows townships to regulate teleconununication towers in areas zoned for residential use. Division (C) allows limited regulation over public utilities engaged in the business of transporting personas or property over any public street, road, or highway. Neither division has any application to electric generating and distribution facilities.\n",
      "3 A & B Refuse Disposers, Inc v. Ravenna Twp. Bd of Trustees (1992),64 Ohio SUd 385, defines \"publIc utilIty\" for purposes of township zoning. A discussion of the characteristics of a \"public utility\" is beyond the scope of this opinion.\n",
      "4 An electric generating facility with a capacity of 50 megawatts or more qualifies as a \"major utility facilIty.\" See R.C. 4906.01(B)(I).\n",
      "5 R.C. 505.86 allows boards of township truStees to provide for the removal, repair, or securance of buildings or other structures that have been declared insecure, unsafe, or structurally defective by any fire department, county building department, or board ofheallh.\n",
      "2\n",
      "certificates to construct major utility facilities, including electric generating plants designed for, or capable of, operation at a capacity of 50 megawatts or more. 6\n",
      "More specifically, R.c. 4906.13 provides:\n",
      "No public agency or political subdivision of this state may require any approval, consent, pelmit, certificate, or other condition for the construction or initial operation of a major utility facility authorized by a certificate issued pursuant to [this chapter). ... Nothing herein shall prevent the application of state laws for the protection of employees engaged in the construction of such facility nor of municipal regulations that do not pertain to the location or design of, or pollution control and abatement standards for, a major utility facility for which a certificate has been granted under this chapter.\n",
      "The first sentence of R.C. 4906.13 wholly exempts the siting of major utility facilities from local regulation. 7 The second sentence allows for limited regulation by villages and cities. This sentence makes no provision for townships, however. Therefore, a township has no authority to impose any condition, including the posting of a decommissioning bond or plan, on the construction or initial operation of a major utility facility.\n",
      "It should also be noted that the jurisdiction of the Power Siting Board is not\n",
      "dependent upon whether the \"major utility facility\" is owned or operated by a public utility. In that regard, R.C. 4906.04 provides in part:\n",
      "No person shall commence to construct a major utility facility in this state without first having obtained a certificate for the facility [from the Power Siting Board). ...\n",
      "R.c. 4906.01(A), in tum, defines a \"person\" as \"an individual, corporation, business trust, association, estate, trust, or partnership or any officer, board, commission, department, division, or bureau of the state or a political subdivision of the state, or any other entity.\" This definition of \"person\" includes anyone wishing to construct a major utility facility, without regard to whether they are a public utility.\n",
      "Furthermore, if multiple wind turbines are connected together and enter the grid at\n",
      "a single point, this office believes that their generating capacities should be aggregated, for purposes of determining whether the project qualifies as a \"major utility facility.\" If the aggregate capacity is 50 megawatts or more, a township would have no authority to condition the operation of a wind turbine or wind farm on the posting of a decommissioning bond or plan.\n",
      "6 E.g., Slale ex reI. State Edison Co. v. Parrott (1995), 73 Ohio SUd 705, 707.\n",
      "7 Parrott, 73 Ohio St.3d at 707, 709; CheSler Township v. Power Siting Cornm (1977),49 Ohio St.2d 231, 234\n",
      "3\n",
      "Rather, the siting procedure set forth in Revised Code Chapter 4906 and the accompanying administrative rules make provision for public comment. This forum may allow township officials or residents to address the decommissioning issue. Otherwise, it appears that a township's only authority regarding the decommissioning of wind turbines or wind farms with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or more is R.C. 505.86.\n",
      "c. Agricultural Use\n",
      "Wind turbines used primarily to generate electrical power for agricultural\n",
      "activities might also be exempt from township zoning. provides in part:\n",
      "In that regard, R.C. 519.21(A)\n",
      "Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, sections 519.02 to 519.25 of the Revised Code confer no power on any township zoning commission, board of township trustees, or board of zoning appeals to prohibit the use of any land for agricultural purposes or the construction or use of buildings or structures incident to the use for agricultural purposes of the land on which such buildings or structures are located[.] ...\n",
      "(emphasis added).\n",
      "For purposes ofR.C. 519.21(A), a structure is \"incident to the use for agricultural\n",
      "purposes of the land\" where the structure is directly and immediately related to an agricultural use, or is usually or naturally and inseparably dependent upon an agricultural use. 8 In light of this test, wind turbines that generate electricity that is used for agricultural purposes would appear to be directly and immediately related to an agricultural use, and therefore, exempt from township zoning. If so, a township would have no authority to require the posting of a decommissioning bond or plan as a condition for the wind turbine's erection. Of course, if the wind turbine is abandoned, and therefore no longer used for agricultural purposes, the township would be able to address its removal via the process set forth in R.c. 505.86.\n",
      "d. Non-Major Utility Facilities Owned or Operated by Non-Public Utilities\n",
      "Notwithstanding the broad exemptions provided by Revised Code Chapters 519\n",
      "and 4906 of the Revised Code, some wind turbines and wind farms might still be subject to township zoning. For example, wind turbines and wind farms owned or operated by non-pUblic utilities with a generating capacity under 50 megawatts cannot avail themselves of either the public utility exemption or the major utility facility exemption. Such facilities may be subject to township zoning resolutions. Similarly, small-scale wind turbines intended for personal use might be subject to township zoning.\n",
      "In such cases, a township, as part of the authority granted by Revised Code Chapter 519, may require the posting of a decommissioning bond or plan. A number of\n",

      "BLOOMINGTON – Flat land and open fields in Central Illinois allow for consistent winds, helping the state become a leader in the nation’s “wind belt” region amid the fight against climate change.\n",
      "Producing zero carbon emissions, McLean County’s wind farms have churned out enough energy to power more than 250,000 homes per year while raking in millions of dollars in property taxes to the county. About 65% of those taxes – $38.3 million – have funded some local school districts since 2007.\n",
      "In the 21st century, Illinois’ wind energy production has grown from 0 megawatt hours produced per year to about 17,000 megawatt hours in 2020, climbing its way to fifth in the country in wind capacity.\n",
      "McLean County has the top wind farm energy capacity in the state, according to a December 2020 report by a professor of economics at Illinois State University in Normal and co-founder of the Center for Renewable Energy. The county currently has four wind farms: High Trail Wind Farm, which went active in 2007; Old Trail Wind Farm in 2008; White Oak Wind Farm in 2011; and Bright Stalk Wind Farm in 2019.\n",
      "The county recently approved a fifth wind farm to be built in the southeast corner of McLean County – the Sapphire Sky Wind Project. Construction is expected to begin Oct. 15.\n",
      "Not everyone is excited about the growth. Approval of the wind farms has come despite objections from some neighbors and rural residents, who point to concerns about the turbines’ noise and interference with weather radar, among other factors.\n",
      "But greater wind energy capacity is on the horizon. Developers hope to build more in McLean County, and pending legislation in the General Assembly could even lead to more growth in the region’s wind capacity and other renewable energies.\n",
      "McLean County wind farms\n",
      "Wind energy companies Apex Clean Energy and Enel Green Power are planning to bring wind farms No. 6 and 7 to McLean County in the near future, McLean County Farm Bureau Assistant Manager Anna Ziegler confirmed.\n",
      "Virginia-based Apex’s Diamond Grove wind farm initially aimed to be in production by 2024. The company’s plan includes building 75 turbines in southern McLean County between Heyworth and LeRoy.\n",
      "It would be a 300-megawatt farm capable of powering about 112,500 homes per year.\n",
      "Enel Green Power, which is currently constructing DeWitt County’s first wind farm, plans to build McLean County’s seventh wind farm, called Pumpkin Vine, on the county’s west side along the Tazewell County line.\n",
      "Specific information about the Pumpkin Vine wind farm is not available, but Ziegler said the company is “in the very early stages” of development.\n",
      "She added that the McLean County Farm Bureau is “neutral” on wind farm projects and solely provides information to its members.\n",
      "“We have members on both sides of the issue every time,” Ziegler said. “We have landowners that want to have the opportunity to have a turbine and we have landowners that don’t want them in the area.”\n",
      "McLean County’s four wind farms – comprised of 397 turbines – produced about 1.61 million megawatt hours in 2019, according to the latest data available for all four farms from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n",
      "The four farms have generated about $59 million in property tax revenue for McLean County since 2007, according to McLean County tax records.\n",
      "Old Trail Wind Farm near Ellsworth has brought the most tax revenue to the county – about $22.7 million – since 2008. That’s about $1.75 million per year. Its 120 turbines also have generated the most power per year at 562,410 megawatt hours, totaling about 7.87 million megawatt hours in 13 1/2 years.\n",
      "High Trail Wind Farm near Ellsworth – the county’s oldest – has made the county about $20.3 million since it became operable in 2007, providing about $1.45 million per year in property taxes. Its 120 turbines have generated the most power among the county’s four farms at just more than 8 million megawatt hours, or about 537,000 megawatt hours per year.\n",
      "White Oak Wind Farm’s total tax revenue is about $13.4 million since it went active in 2011 near Carlock, paying about $1.34 million in property taxes per year. Its 100 turbines produced 3.78 million megawatt hours between 2011 and 2019, according to the most recent data available. That amounts to about 420,304 megawatt hours per year.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Bright Stalk Wind Farm’s first property tax payment in 2020 was about $2.5 million. Its 57 turbines in Chenoa and Lexington have produced about 1.11 million megawatt hours between 2019 and 2021.\n",
      "Houston-based EDP Renewables operates the Bright Stalk Wind Farm and the two-phase Twin Groves farms, also known as the Old Trail and High Trail wind farms.\n",
      "Blair Matocha, a spokesperson for EDP Renewables, told The Pantagraph that the company “continues to explore development opportunities – both for wind farms and solar parks – in McLean County due to its supportive landowners and other stakeholders, vast wind and sun resource, and access to the electric transmission grid.”\n",
      "Matocha also said some of Bright Stalk’s energy helps power software company Salesforce and the retail giant Walmart.\n",
      "“Offtakers privately purchase energy from both phases of the Twin Groves Wind Farm,” Matocha said. “While these companies are the direct purchasers of the power from these wind farms, the actual electrons that are generated are delivered to power lines that run across the county, and travel along the path of least resistance to wherever the power is needed.”\n",
      "But the boom in wind energy has not been approved harmoniously, as some residents have spoken against wind farm projects near their property for various reasons. And one wind farm project in Central Illinois has had a share of legal challenges.\n",
      "A group of 69 DeWitt County residents filed a lawsuit against the DeWitt County Board and Enel Green Power in an attempt to stop the county’s first wind farm from being constructed. Another lawsuit aimed to halt construction was filed last year by the Village of Wapella and its mayor Sherry Mears. Those lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed by the constituents in March and construction continued until recently.\n",
      "The DeWitt County Board voted in July to suspend issuance of any building permits for the project until Enel Green Power could show the board its permission from power companies to curtail the windmills during severe weather. The wind energy company filed a lawsuit last month against DeWitt County to demand 15 building permits be issued.\n",
      "Wind farm opposition\n",
      "McLean County’s wind farm projects also have faced some resistance, particularly from local landowners who question whether the proximity of turbines near where they live and work can lead to adverse health effects.\n",
      "Others have raised concerns over negative impacts from turbine construction, like leaving rural roads in poor condition and spreading large amounts of dust. Turbines also can create interference on Doppler radar, though area meteorologists have said they know what to look for and are still able to track storms.\n",
      "One of the most critical voices echoing through turbine-dotted farmland and county board rooms belongs to Carolyn Taylor, the great-great-granddaughter of Henry West, the namesake of West Township in the southeast corner of McLean County.\n",
      "It’s there and in Bellflower Township where Taylor has kept wind energy companies from erecting turbines on two swaths of farmland belonging to her family.\n",
      "Although she “completely believes in the value of wind energy,” Taylor, a psychotherapist and sociolinguist who taught at the University of Illinois in the 1990s, also describes herself as “pro-health” and “pro-well-being.”\n",
      "In letters sent to the McLean County Zoning Board, Taylor primarily takes issue with existing county-level building regulations that “let wind companies put way too many wind turbines too close” to farms and homes that both opt in and opt out of permitting turbines on parcels of their land.\n",
      "Both participants and non-participants, Taylor told The Pantagraph, are prone to negative physiological and mental health effects because the turbines stand too close to where they live and work.\n",
      "Taylor said one of the most serious effects can be caused by turbine flicker. That phenomenon occurs when the sun is low in the sky and a turbine creates a shadow on a building. As the turbine blades pass in front of the sun, the shadow moves, appearing to flick on and off.\n",
      "The movement can be especially harmful for people who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy and can trigger seizures or dizziness.\n",
      "“(Wind companies and county officials) are not even thinking about the quality of living at home,” Taylor said. “With the sunset or the sunrise, every time you’d be blinded by the strobe-like effect of shadow flicker.”\n",
      "Other effects follow from infrasound – a low-frequency noise emitted from turbines and their equipment – and audible machinery noise. When a turbine is too close to a home, Taylor said both noises can negatively affect a person’s nervous system or their sleeping patterns.\n",
      "Those outcomes and other problems, self-reported by people living near wind turbines in a number of countries, including Canada, Japan and Finland, have been the impetus for a number of studies.\n",
      "A 2017 survey of existing studies on infrasound concluded that “proximity of a wind turbine or wind farm has not conclusively been proven to negatively affect stress responses, quality of life, sleep quality (subjective and objective) nor other health complaints.”\n",
      "The reason for that outcome, the study’s authors wrote, is “that individual traits and attitudes, visual aspects as well as the process of wind farm planning and decision-making are highly likely to influence the response to sound from wind turbines.”\n",
      "Despite the ambiguity over negative human health effects directly linked to wind turbine operation and placement, Taylor said potential participants should at least be aware of the potential health risks associated with wind energy.\n",
      "And what’s more, she said county officials should take more care to educate themselves and their constituents before approving a new wind project.\n",
      "“There’s a lot here leading to no truly-informed consent,” Taylor said. “People are hiding the fact that wind companies are putting turbines right in the danger area near houses.”\n",
      "McLean County zoning code currently mandates that a single turbine must be set back from the property line of a non-participating landowner a distance at least 1.1 times the total height of the turbine, and must be set back from an occupied residence a distance at least 3 times the total height of the turbine.\n",
      "That means a 500-foot tall turbine, for instance, would need to be placed 550 feet from a nonparticipating farmer’s property line, or 1,500 feet from a home that someone lives in.\n",
      "Nearly all four wind farms in McLean County have at least one turbine that falls closer to a residence or property line. In those cases, the wind company will negotiate an enhanced payment with the landowner to accommodate the exception.\n",
      "Taylor said county officials should extend the minimum set-back distances from residential and agricultural property lines to at least 1.5 miles.\n",
      "“Wind farms are great, but less than 1/3 of a mile from a farm or near people’s home? No,” Taylor said. “They belong on hillsides, where nothing else is there – no homes, no active farms. That’s where the wind farms belong, not in the middle of where people live.”\n",
      "State renewable energy goals\n",
      "Illinois is among a majority of states that have a renewable portfolio standard, which is a policy that requires electric utilities to procure a certain percentage of electricity from renewable sources.\n",
      "Illinois’ RPS, first enacted in 2007, requires that major utilities like Ameren and Commonwealth Edison obtain 25% of their electricity from renewable resources by 2025. Of that, 75% must come from wind and 6% from solar.\n",
      "Funds for these renewable projects comes from charges found on customer utility bills, which are pooled to procure renewable energy credits.\n",
      "Across the state’s major utilities, this has led to about $225 million annually for renewable energy projects, according to the Illinois Power Agency.\n",
      "This pot of cash has been used to incentivize continued private sector investment in wind projects and to kickstart the state’s solar industry.\n",
      "The RPS undoubtedly “helps spur demand for wind projects,” said Matthew Tulis, a spokesman for RWE Renewables, a German energy company with three active wind farms containing more than 300 turbines in the state.\n",
      "Their portfolio includes two 150-megawatt farms in Iroquois County, which opened in 2011 and 2012 respectively, and were the first two projects the company undertook in the MISO energy market. They produce enough energy to power 90,000 homes.\n",
      "The company’s most recent project is Radford’s Run, a 306-megawatt farm in northwestern Macon County that went online in 2017. The 139-turbine facility generates enough energy to power about 100,000 homes.\n",
      "A proposal for a fourth farm containing between 48 to 66 turbines in McDonough County is also under consideration.\n",
      "“Illinois has a very robust wind resource along with available land for development in Central Illinois,” Tulis said. “There is also available transmission to get the power from where it is generated to where there is a demand.”\n",
      "But even with investments from companies like RWE, Illinois is far short of meeting its renewable goals.\n",
      "The state’s interim renewable energy target for 2020 was 17.5%. In reality, just over 11% of the state’s electricity came from those sources – triple the amount generated in 2010 but still far from where the state set out to be.\n",
      "Though the Future Energy Jobs Act, signed into law by then-Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2017, increased state investment in wind and solar projects, it was far short of what was necessary to make a meaningful dent in those ambitious clean energy goals.\n",
      "Faced with this reality, climate activists and their allies in Springfield are making another push to move the state toward a clean energy future.\n",
      "A proposal backed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and groups like the Illinois Environmental Council and the Sierra Club would double the state’s investment in renewable energy – tacking on an additional few bucks a month onto residential ratepayers to help pay for it.\n",
      "The proposed legislation would build on the 25% renewable energy by the 2025 goal, setting a new interim target of 40% by 2030, which would eventually set the state on a path toward 100% clean generation by 2050.\n",
      "Stakeholders hoped to have a bill on Pritzker’s desk by now, but negotiations hit a snag in late May over the timeline for decarbonization, with labor unions holding out for a longer ramp than the 2035 shuttering date for most coal-fired plants and 2045 for natural gas plants.\n",
      "The Illinois Senate, meeting in a special session on Tuesday, passed an energy bill that includes the increased investments for renewable energy projects and gives a hard 2045 closure date for municipally-owned coal-fired power plants like the Prairie State Generating Station in Marissa and City Water, Light and Power in Springfield.\n",
      "However, Pritzker and his environmental allies are not on board, still concerned about the lack of intermittent targets for carbon reduction at coal and natural gas plants.\n",
      "At stake is not only the fate of the state’s nuclear fleet – two plants will close in a matter of weeks without ratepayer-funded subsidies included in the legislation – but the state’s renewable energy market.\n",
      "Lawmakers may return later this month to hammer out a deal.\n",
      "Solar to rise, but wind still rules region\n",
      "Though renewables currently make up a small slice of Illinois’ energy pie, more than 94% of that comes from wind energy.\n",
      "That renewable energy portfolio will not be as slanted toward wind in the future, experts say, with solar quickly becoming more competitive on price and flexible in terms of where it can be used.\n",
      "But wind is likely to remain dominant in Central Illinois as the “the wind resource is stronger” and “there’s available land” for more large-scale projects, said Jack Darin, director of the Sierra Club’s Illinois chapter.\n",
      "“The wind development to date in Central Illinois has not been limited by our need for the power or the availability of the wind resource,” Darin said. “It’s been limited by the slow and steady growth of overall renewable energy percentage of the state.”\n",
      "“Central Illinois is one of the places in Illinois that is going to see targeted investment because of the strength of the wind resource there,” Darin said.\n",

      "FINDINGS OF FACT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE McLEAN COUNTY ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS\n",
      "This is the findings of fact and the recommendation of the McLean County Zoning Board of Appeals to the McLean County Board concerning an application of Amy Toohill in case SU-07- 01, part of parcel 18-32-200-003. She is requesting a special use to allow a single family residence in the Agriculture District for the daughter of a farm owner on property which is located in Anchor Township immediately east of 3800 East Road (County Highway 17) and approximately 900 feet south of 1500 North Road.\n",
      "After due notice, as required by law, the Zoning Board of Appeals held a public hearing in this case on March 6, 2007 in Room 400, Government Center, 115 East Washington Street, Bloomington, Illinois and hereby report their findings of fact and their recommendation as follows:\n",
      "PHYSICAL LAYOUT - The 1.5 acre property is vacant and is currently in crop production. The property has 200 feet of frontage pn the west side of 3800 East Road, an asphalt road 24 feet in width. The property is relatively flat and drains to the south and west.\n",
      "SURROUNDING ZONING AND LAND USES - The property is surrounded by land in the A-Agriculture District. The land to the north, south and east is in crop production. A farm dwelling owned by the applicant's parents is located to the west.\n",
      "LAND EVALUATION AND SITE ASSESSMENT (LESA) - A LESA analysis was completed for the site. The soils score was 105 out of 125 points. The site assessment score was 119 out of 175 points. The total LESA score was 224 points out of 300. A score of below 225 points means the property is of low value for agricultural land protection.\n",
      "ANALYSIS OF STANDARDS - After considering all the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, this Board makes the following analysis of the standards contained in the McLean County Zoning Ordinance regarding the recommendation by the Zoning Board of Appeals as to whether the County Board should grant or deny-the proposed special use.\n",
      "STANDARDS FOR RECOMMENDING:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "The proposed special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the health, safety, morals, comfort, or welfare of the public. This standard is met. The applicant is the daughter of the owner of the original agriculture tract from which this property is being set aside. The applicant indicated that she helps her father with raising hogs on the adjacent property.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "The proposed special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for purposes already permitted or substantially diminish property values in the immediate area. This standard is met. The proposed dwelling for the daughter of the owner of the agricultural tract from which the proposed lot is being set aside is compatible with uses in the vicinity.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "The proposed special use will not impede the orderly development of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. This standard is met. The applicant is the daughter of the owner of the farm from which this property is set aside.\n",
      "33\n",
      "Findi11gs and Reco1nmendation SU-07-01, Page 2\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or will be provided. This standard is met. The proposed dwelling will be served by private well and septic system that will need to be approved by the County Health Department. The applicant is working with the Health Department to install a new septic system for her parent's house that will remain on the farm. This will need to be addressed when the property is subdivided. The property has 200 feet of frontage on the west side of 3800 East Road.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. This standard is met. It appears that safe sight distance can be provided at the proposed entrance. The applicant has obtained approval from the County Highway Department for the applicant to use the existing entrance for the proposed dwelling.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "The establishment, maintenance and operation of the special use will be in conformance with the preamble to the regulations of the Agriculture District. This standard is met.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "The proposed special use, in all other respects, conforms to the applicable regulations of the Agriculture District. This standard is met.\n",
      "After considering all the evidence and testimony presented, this Board finds that the application meets all the standards as found in the McLean County Zoning Ordinance, provided one of the initial occupants of the proposed dwelling is the applicant and provided a one lot subdivision is approved for the proposed residence.\n",
      "Therefore this Board recommends that a special use be granted on the property described above to allow the construction of one single family dwelling along with future customary accessory buildings and structures as may be approved by the Director of Building and Zoning and that development follows the plans and specifications as presented with such minor changes as the Director of Building and Zoning may determine to be in general compliance with such plans and specifications and with zoning regulations and provided the above conditions are met.\n",

      "Dear Mr. Sweeney:\n",
      "The Sheriffs Department advertised and asked for bids to replace 7 police squad cars, 1 vehicle used by the Coroner's Office, (Coroner Kimmerling's squad), and a pickup truck used by COMLARA Park. We asked that the bidding dealerships submit bids for three types of vehicles:\n",
      "L\n",
      "full size rear wheel drive vehicle meeting certain specifications (for the Sheriffs Office)\n",
      "2. mid-size front wheel drive vehicle meeting certain specifications 3. mid-size extended cab pickup truck.\n",
      "Coroner Kimrnerling did not express a preference as to drive type or size. Knowing that the Sheriffs Office vehicle bid request would include a vehicle like the one currently being used by Coroner Kimmerling, but not knowing if it would fall within budget, we also asked for bids for a mid-size front wheel drive vehicle, as well.\n",
      "Since Ms. Kimmerling is currently using a full size rear wheel vehicle and a like car falls within budget, I recommend that we purchase one (1) Ford Crown Victoria from Wright's Automotive for the Coroner's Office, at a cost of$20,355.40.\n",
      "It is my recommendation that we purchase one (1) Dodge Dakota extended cab pickup truck from Wright's Automotive for COMLARA Park, at a cost of$17,435.00.\n",
      "It is my recommendation that we purchase seven (7) Ford Crown Victoria squad cars from Wright's Automotive at the cost of $20,355.40 each. Each of these vehicles would\n",
      "38\n",
      "Mr. Michael Sweeney March 8, 2007 Page2\n",
      "have a corresponding trade-in vehicle. I would also recommend that we purchase one (1) additional Ford Crown Victoria squad car from Wright's at the cost of$20,355.40 to replace a wrecked squad. This vehicle would not have a corresponding trade-in; rather we are anticipating an insurance reimbursement of $15 ,000.00.\n",

      "The Enterprise Zone (EZ) was established in 1984 by joint agreement by the City of Bloomington, Town of Normal and Mclean County to help provide additional incentives to the new Mitsubishi Plant being located in the area. The EZ is a creation of the State of Illinois and because of that we can only offer the incentives outlined in the State enabling·ordinance. Expansion of the EZ is also dictated by State statute and it allows expansion by two methods: Option 1 which is for single purpose projects, or by Option 2, expanding the EZ through the original poverty criteria.\n",
      "Any expansion of the EZ will be considered only if the project meets two of the three following criteria:\n",
      "1. The project must create or retain 100 full-time equivalent primary wage jobs within 12 months of the project approval. Primary wage jobs are defined by jobs paying 50% of the median family income for the community.\n",
      "2. The value of real property in the project must be at least $1 O million, excluding land, soft costs, as well as fixtures, furniture and equipment.\n",
      "3. The project must generate tax revenue of $100,000. This can be sales tax or property tax or a total based upon the combination of both.\n",
      "Once this criterion is met, the potential applicant must show the EZ Administi:ator that a building or site in the current boundaries of the EZ is not suitable due to · one or more of the following conditions:\n",
      "1. Inadequate utilities to meet the needs of the project\n",
      "2. Inadequate transportation or rail facilities or access to a site.\n",
      "3. Inability to acquire property at a cost suitable to the project owners.\n",
      "Any expansion of the EZ must meet current long range land use planning requirements and or be consistent with the existing zoning classification.\n",

      "FINDIN\"GS OF FACT AND REC011MENDATION OF THE McLEAN COUNTY ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS\n",
      "This is the findings of fact and the recommendation of the McLean County Zoning Board of Appeals to the McLean County Board concerning an application of White Oak Energy, LLC in case SU-06-19. They are requesting a special use permit to allow a Major Utility (wind farm of up to 100 wind turbine generators) on 12,212 acres in the Agriculture District. The application also includes the request of applying for building permits for the project up to three years after County Board approval rather than one year as allowed, on property which is part of Townships 24N Range lE (Dry Grove Township), 25N Range 2E (Hudson Township), 24N Range 2E · (Normal Township) & 25NRange lE (White Oak Township) of the 3rd P.M. in Mclean County, IL:\n",
      "After due notice, as required by law, the Zoning Board of Appeals held a public hearing in this case on November 21, 2006, January 16, 17 and 18, 2007 in Rooms 1406and1407, Community Commons Building, Heartland Community College, 1500 W. Raab Road, Normal, Illinois and January 22, 24, 25 and 29, 30 and 31, 2007 and February 5, 7, and 8, 2007 in Room400 of the Government Center, 115 East Washington Street, Bloomington, Illinois and hereby report their findings of fact and their recommendation as follows:\n",
      "The Zoning Board of Appeals exhibited a reasoned approach to this case as illustrated by the following examples:\n",
      "1)\n",
      "2)\n",
      "3) 4) 5)\n",
      "A large room at Heartland Community College was reserved in which to conduct the hearing to accommodate an anticipated large group. The Zoning Board of Appeals extended the public hearing 58 days at the request of the objectors in order to better prepare their case. 40 some hours of testimony was heard from both sides. People from outside McLean County were allowed to give testimony and ask questions. Applicants and objectors were allowed to speak out of order; an objector's expert witness was allowed to complete testimony through a phone call.\n",
      "The intent of the Agriculture District as stated in the Zoning Ordinance is as follows:\n",
      "\"Agricultural land is under urban pressure from expanding incorporated areas. This urban pressure takes the form of scattered development in wide belts around the· incorporated communities of McLean County, brings conflicting land uses into juxtaposition, creates high costs for public services and stimulates land speculation. Certain agricultural land constitutes unique and irreplaceable land resources. It is the purpose of the Agricultural District to provide a means by which agricultural land may be protected and enhanced as an economic and environmental resource of major importance to the County. Therefore, the Agricultural District is intended to accomplish the following objectives: Promote the use of ag1icultural land that is most suitable for fanning activities.\n",
      "Protect the value of agricultural land from indiscriminate incompatible and conflicting land uses.\n",
      "Conserve and protect open space, wooded areas, streams, mineral deposits and other natural resources from incompatible land uses and provide for their timely utilization.\n",
      "157\n",
      "Findings and Recommendation SU-06-19, Page 2\n",
      "Provide for the location and govern the establishment and operation of land uses which are compatible with agriculture and are of such a nature that their location away from residential, commercial and industrial areas is most desirable.\n",
      "Provide for the location and govern the establishment and use of residential uses that are accessory to and necessary for the conduct of agriculture.\n",
      "Provide for the location and govern the establishment and use of limited non-fa1m dwellings.\"\n",
      "No testimony was presented indicating that the proposed wind farm would diminish our dependence on foreign oil.\n",
      "The proposed Wind farm will not cause emissions and would be a step in the right direction to help in the overall reduction of emissions.\n",
      "The proposed location is desirable for a wind farm since the wind resource, access to the power grid and the electric power consumers are at the proposed location.\n",
      "Water usage in the proposed wind farm area is a significant concern as identified by testimony about an inadequate supply of well water. Water use in wind electricity production versus coal burning electricity production is significantly less. The only water use for wind is in the construction phase for the concrete foundation. A coal burning plant uses up to 11.6 million gallons per day. The water for the concrete used in the proposed wind farm should come from a supply outside the project area such as the City of Bloomington or Town of Normal.\n",
      "The amount of property tax revenue generated by the proposed wind farm has not been determined and is not a relevant issue as to whether this project meets the standards for approval.\n",
      "A credible expert, Dr. Peter Poletti, testified that the project would not negatively impact property values in the area. Objectors were very concerned about property values. Mr. Michael Miller, an actuary, successfully disputed some of the methods that Dr. Poletti used, but on the other hand, Mr. Miller did not present any other study that said the values would go down. The one study that Mr. Miller mentioned, indicated the wind farm did not have any impact on property values or was inconclusive.\n",
      "Two credible experts, one local, Dr. Angelo Capparella, and one hired by the applicant, Dr. Paul Kerlinger, testified that the project would not cause significant harm to birds and bats. Upon Dr. Capparella's advice, the applicant moved several proposed turbines from critical bird/bat habitats in the area. The old style California wind turbines and their locations in critical wild life habitat areas and migratory paths gave wind farms a bad reputation as far as birds were concerned. Also, fossil fuel energy plants are much more harmful for birds and wildlife than wind farms.\n",
      "Expert testimony was presented that the project be at least one mile from the Mackinaw River and one half mile from Evergreen Lake. In McLean County, the project area is more than one mile from the flood plain of the Mackinaw River.\n",
      "158\n",
      "Findings and Reco1nn1endation SU-06-19, Page 3\n",
      "Ice throws and proposed turbines located close to property lines were identified as concerns. This problem would be taken care of if a setback from property lines was imposed such as 1.1 times the height of the tower as recommended by a Model Ordinance, prepared by the Chicago Legal Clinic. The Model Ordinance states that all turbines shall be set back a distance of at least 1.1 times the height of the tower from non-participating property lines. The affected adjacent property owner may waive this setback requirement.\n",
      "The noise of the project was identified as a concern. Construction noise will be a temporary disruption. The applicant has submitted a noise analysis and expert testimony indicating that the project meets the accepted norm, and that the greater the distance the lower the noise. It was discussed that 1,200 feet should be a minimum. Turbines will be set back 2,000 feet from the boundary line of the R-1 Single Family Residence District as measured from the tip of the blade, 1,500 feet from non participating dwellings in the Agriculture District with the exception of three residences whose owners have requested a waiver that will allow them to be as close as 1,030 feet from three non participating residences; Jim Visel's (1248 feet), Jim and Sandra Schwoerer's (1,030 feet), and Thomas Schwoerer's (1,167 feet).\n",
      "Roads in the area that will be used for the project should be improved to Illinois Department of Transportation standards as a result of the project at no cost to the taxpayer. The applicant has been working with the County and four townships to obtain road agreements to maintain the roads and provide adequate access during the construction process. The applicant has a verbal road agreement with the County and the four townships; a written agreement will need to be in place before the County Board takes action on this application. It was discussed that Mr. Jeff Tracy of the County Highway Department should keep an eye on the road conditions during construction to make sure the roads are properly maintained. Where there is a common spot where a group of children congregate at a school bus stop where safety from construction traffic for the project is identified as a concern by the County Engineer, a shelter or staging area shall be strongly encouraged to be provided.\n",
      "The effect of flicker from turbine blades was found to be limited or not an effect at a distance of over 1,200 feet.\n",
      "The turbine lighting will be determined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and will be installed for safety of aircraft. In the past, many people objected to cell tower lighting; now such lighting goes unnoticed.\n",
      "The aerial spraying of 20% to 30% of the crop land in the project area may not be feasible by fixed wing aircraft; the remainder could be done at an increased cost to the property owner. It was pointed out by Mr. Schertz, an aerial crop dusting pilot, that turbines located in a linear pattern would be easier to spray around. Although this may be difficult to do, the applicant is encouraged to place turbines in a linear pattern. Aerial spraying of crops in the wind farm area will be more difficult to accomplish using fix winged aircraft. Aerial spraying in the wind farm area may be enhanced by the use of helicopters. Aerial spraying may include a cost surcharge of 50% for crops in the project area according to Mr. Schertz. Farmers in the project area are aware of the limitation to aerial spraying and are prepared to take the risk. It was found that ground spraying of crop land can be done in pretty wet conditions in tiled fields (fields that have been tiled for\n",
      "159\n",
      "Findings and Reconuuendation SU~06~19, Page 4\n",
      "drainage purposes) in McLean County with the equipment now available. Ground spraying is almost always preferable to aerial spraying in McLean County.\n",
      "Testimony was presented that the proposed facility could cause problems with existing communications in the area. Remedies to these communications problems can be found. It was found that homeowners or existing property owners should not be required to resolve these problems on their own when caused by the proposed project. Interruptions of existing television, internet and microwave communication services will need to be rectified by the applicant at the applicant's expense.\n",
      "The problem of high speed winds and tornadoes was discussed. It is difficult to protect against a tornado event. The proposed setbacks were determined to adequately address this problem.\n",
      "Soil erosion and the repair of disturbed field tile during the construction phase needs to be addressed. The applicant is encouraged to consult a conservation biologist, the McLean County Soil and Water Conservation District and conservation groups to limit soil erosion in the project area, particularly where crossing or trenching across creeks and wetland areas. The applicant shall repair damaged field tile to the satisfaction of the farm owner. The applicant shall handle problem solving in this area proactively in a cooperative manner. The applicant shall provide erosion remediation when notified to do so by the Director of Building and Zoning.\n",
      "The project is found to help preserve farm land for agricultural purposes. Established policies and the County Comprehensive Plan have limited and continue to limit residential development in the project area. Most of the growth in the area will likely take place around villages and towns in the next 25 years. Residential development is directed toward villages such as Carlock and Bloomington/Normal where smaller lot sizes are a more efficient use of land and where better water and sewer resources are available. The project would be 4,000 feet from the Village of Carlock, 1 Yi miles from the Town of Normal and 2,000 feet from residentially zoned property lines in the unincorporated area of the County.\n",
      "Testimony was presented that turbines may create a unique problem for the rescue of injured workers and for fighting fires. The applicant indicated that they have been working with the Town of Normal in this regard. It is necessary to work with other fire district as well. The applicant shall cooperate with the local fire districts to provide financial support for <iny necessary specialized training before permits are issued.\n",
      "ANALYSIS OF STANDARDS - After considering all the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, this Board makes the following analysis of the standards contained in the McLean County Zoning Ordinance regarding the recommendation by the Zoning Board of Appeals as to whether the County Board should grant or deny the proposed special use.\n",
      "STANDARDS FOR RECOMMENDING:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "The proposed special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the health, safety, morals, comfort, or welfare of the public. This standard is met. The applicant is proposing to build a Major Utility (Wind Power Generating Facility) of up to 100 wind turbines on 12,211 acres in the Agriculture District in an area that is primarily used for\n",
      "160\n",
      "Findings and Reconuncndation SU-06-19, Page 5\n",
      "agriculture. The proposed wind turbines would be a maximum of 499 feet in height as measured from the ground to the tip of the blade. The blades and hub would be approximately 82.5 meters (271 feet) in diameter and the hub would be approximately 80 meters (264 feet) above the ground. The turbines will be set back from roads and non participating property lines a distance of 1.1 times the height from the edge of the road right of-way and non participating property Jines as measured from the tip of the blade.\n",
      "The applicant has submitted an avian risk assessment of the study area. The applicant is also in the process of completing a cultural and archaeological survey to determine areas of significance within the project area. The applicant will need to receive a compliance letter from the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency before constmction can begin.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "The proposed special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for purposes already permitted or substantially diminish property values in the immediate area. This standard is met. The surrounding property that is currently used for crop production will continue to be desirable for such use. Adequate evidence was not submitted indicating that property values in the area would go down. Much testimony was presented that the project would interfere with the view of the horizon or the sunset; but you cannot buy that sunset unless you buy the land that it is over. The applicant shall coordinate safety issues during construction with road commissioners, police, fire, schools, EMT and the public.\n",
      "The applicant will need to maintain a 2000 foot setback requirement from property in the R- 1 Single Family Residence District. All turbines shall be set back a distance of at least 1.1 times the height of the tower from non-participating property lines; the affected adjacent property owner may waive this setback requirement. The minimum turbine setback from non-participating landowners' homes will be 1500 feet with the exception of three residences whose owners have requested a waiver. The applicant is proposing to locate two of the turbines that will be as close as 1000 feet from three non participating residences; Jim Visel's (1200 feet), Jim & Sandra Schwoerer's, and Thomas Schwoerer's. The applicant has obtained written approvals from all three owners of the residences that are affected by these two towers. The minimum turbine setback from participating landowners' homes will be 700 feet. The applicant has submitted a noise analysis.\n",
      "The project will be built in one phase. The applicant is allowed to apply for the first building permit up to three years after County Board approval rather than one year as allowed. The applicant has submitted specific information on longitude, latitude, elevation, and construction height of the turbines to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for review and approval. The applicant will need to meet the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lighting requirements and site approval for each wind turbine within the project area before construction will begin. The applicant shall provide engineering plans, certified by a registered engineer, for each of the wind turbines showing that they are designed according to appropriate national standards. After construction is complete, a registered engineer shall verify they are built according to the plans.\n",

      "land that is suitable for crop production will continue to be suitable for such use. The applicant has decommissioning agreements with each land owner. The applicant will set up an escrow account in the amount of $25,000 per wind turbine beginning twelve years after the start of commercial operations. The decommission fund is intended to cover the cost of removing the project infrastructure, restoring the leased premises to their original condition, and removing the foundation pedestal to seven feet below grade. The applicant has submitted a microwave study for the subject site and shall have necessary FCC approvals before permits will be issued. The applicant has obtained approval from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Endangered Species Consultation Program. The applicant shall rectify any television and internet connection problems and return them to at least the level of service that occurred before the turbines were installed.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or will be provided. This standard is met. The applicant is proposing to build gravel access roads to each tower. The towers do not require septic systems or wells. The applicant will install underground utilities along the access roads to each of the tower sites. The applicant is also proposing one electrical substation and an Operations and Maintenance facility that will be located in Section 36 of White Oak Township and will employ approximately 15 people. The Operation and Maintenance facility will be served by a private well and septic system approved by the County Health Department. A wetland study shall be completed and approved by the Army Corp of Engineers before any permits are issued. The applicant will also need an EPA permit for stormwater management before construction begins. The applicant shall provide erosion remediation when notified to do so by the Director of Building and Zoning. The applicant has submitted a drainage study calculating the runoff under pre-construction and post construction conditions for areas within the project area that drains to Evergreen Lake.\n",

      "Members Gordon/Owens moved the County Board approve a Request for Approval of the Application of White Oak Energy, LLC in case SU-06-19 for a Special Use Permit to allow a Major Utility (wind farm of up to 100 wind turbine generators) on 12,212 acres in the Agriculture District. The Application also includes the request of applying for Building Permits for the Project up to three years after County Board approval rather than one year as allowed, on property which is part of Townships 24N Range 1E (Dry Grove Township), 25N Range 2E (Hudson Township), 24N Range 2E (Normal Township) & 25N Range 1E (White Oak Township) of the 3rd P.M. in Mclean County, IL . Member Gordon stated the following: I would like to turn this over to our attorney Brian Hug. Mr. Hug stated the following: basically it is a typical zoning case that comes before the Board. It is much larger in some respects. I would ask that you make your decision based on the facts and the evidence presented before the Zoning Board of Appeals. If you have other factual findings you would like to make you are free to do so. You may approve the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals, deny it, modify or change it, and you can add to the additional stipulations if you so choose. All that should be based on the evidence presented. Member Caisley stated the following: I would like to propose and amendment to numbered paragraph (7) which currently reads \"The applicant shall cooperate with the local fire districts to provide financial support for any necessary specialized training before permits are issued.\" Chairman Sweeney stated the following: we are going· to pass that out so the Members can read it. Member Caisley stated the following: I was impressed with the testimony of Mrs. McDonald, an objector at the hearings before the Zoning Board of Appeals, and was somewhat concerned about the fire protection in the area. Mrs. McDonald's testimony was cut short because she was relying on hearsay evidence but I think that fires can be a problem because of the height at which the generators are located - 300 above the ground. I would like to amend paragraph (7) to add an additional clause that says \"it shall equip wind turbines with and effective automatic fire suppression system. This was seconded by Member Bostic. Member Selzer stated the following: there are a couple things I don't understand. One is that I do not believe we required this for the other wind farm that exists. As a simple person, I don't understand that this huge metal structure, if the wiring burns up or the generator burns up what we are going to do. I am not quite sure where the danger comes from. I also don't understand the cost associated with this that we are going to burden that person with that we haven't the other ones with. I just don't understand the motivation for the amendment. Member Segobiano stated the following: I have difficulty here in saying \"provide financial support for any necessary specialized training.\" Who determines at what point in time this is an endless process with everyone's concern that it will require specialized piece of equipment? Secondly, we've been given this pass out and if I understood correctly we just heard another motion similar to this. What are we voting on, what was passed out or the verbal motion that was made? Mr. Ruud: just to clarify parliamenta1y what needs to be done, the main motion was set forth by Member Gordon and Owens seconded it and that is the main motion to approve the wind farm. Member Caisley has now made a motion to amend the main motion and the amendment was handed out to you. What you are debating now\n",
      "165\n",
      "is whether or not to include Member Caisley's amendment to the main motion. After debate, the vote will be solely on whether or not to include Member Caisley's amendment. If it passes and it only takes a majority vote, then we are back to the main motion as amended and then would vote on the main motion as amended. Member Gordon stated the following: the amendment includes the two lines that already appear in subparagraph (7). Mr. Ruud stated the following: my understanding is that the motion to amend merely adds the words \"and shall equip the wind turbines with an effective automatic fire suppression system in the nacelle of each turbine.\" Member Rackauskas stated the following: I also agree with Member Selzer. I am a little confused because we just got this at this point. When do we have discussion concerning this? I think there are a lot of variables here i.e. cost, effectiveness, etc. Where do we get that information before we make our vote? We need professional dialogue because we are not firefighters. This is out of our realm. Chairman Sweeney stated the following: I understand. Member Caisley just handed it to me five minutes before the meeting. Member Rackauskas stated the following: I am not saying that it is not valid. I am just asking at what point do we have discussion and does this have to go back to zoning then for testimony. Mr. Hug stated the following: the issue of fire protection came up at the Zoning Board of Appeals hearing as a result of a question that one of the Members of this Board asked that I ask the applicant. The applicant indicated that the majority of their fire protection would come through with an agreement with the Town of Normal and that they had been working with the Chief of the Carlock Fire Department. They did not address an automatic fire suppression system. They were asked to but they did not. I would think that without getting the transcript out I cannot give you a lot more detail. The issue of cost never addressed. Nobody asked the cost. If you choose to send back you need to make certain it is very specific. Did that answer your question? I don't know if that helps or not. Member Rackauskas stated the following: this is one person's opinion when we have no professional information to back it up. Member Gordon asked the following: Does Member Caisley have any further information in regards to cost or risk? Member Caisley stated the following: I was unable to find any information about any fires that have occurred in general electric turbines which are what is proposed for this wind farm; however, I did find information regarding three dozen fires in wind turbines up to January 1, 2006. I don't know if there have been any since that day. 28 of the 36 fires were in Germany where they use various types of European built turbines. Chairman Sweeney stated the following: we probably need to stop there with that testimony and turn this over to Brian Hug. Mr. Hug stated the following: the information that Member Caisley has given is not on the record of Zoning Board of Appeals and technically the applicant and anyone else that would like to question would have a right to present contrary information and cross examine anyone presenting that evidence. That is a big concern about taking evidence outside the record and why you have the Zoning Board of Appeals to take that evidence. Member Owens stated the following: I was curious if Member Caisley recalls what night of hearing the objector brought up this information. Member Caisley stated the following: I don't recall what night it was but I know that the testimony was that of a Mrs. McDonald who lives in the area of the wind farm. Member\n",
      "166\n",
      "Owens stated the following: from.what we have heard from Mr. Hug, if this was not on the last night we could have asked Mr. Hug to gather further information. I applaud Member Caisley on his concern but there is nothing in the record and that is where we need to keep our focus so I will not support the amendment. Member Segobiano stated the following: I don't know as I read what was passed out, in regards to equipping the turbines with effective automatic fire suppression, who makes the determination of what is an effective automatic system. What type; what kind; what is the cost? If that is in the records then I will base my vote that but, as it stands now, I will oppose this motion. Member Selzer asked the following: if the project is approved doesn't this increase the assessed valuation in those areas based on the turbines being on that property? Aren't the fire protection districts going to realize additional dollars as a result, if it is approved? Mr. Hug stated the following: there was a small amount of discussion at the hearings regarding that. Really your question goes to the main motion, unless you think the automatic fire suppression equipment would increase the assessment. There was no testimony regarding automatic fire suppression equipment and whether or not that would affect the assessments. As to the tower itself, there was testimony on both sides indicating that there would be some benefit because of the presence of the towers and that the local governments would receive a benefit from the taxation. There was some testimony that the schools would not get as much money from the State as they would because they would be receiving additional assessed value. Did that answer your question? Member Selzer stated the following: I was driving to the point about providing financial support that Member Segobiano spoke of. We build grain elevators and the fire departments don't get extra dollars for training, etc. I think that they are going to see some of those dollars. Forget about the suppression system for a minute. As a whole, ifthere is an increase in the assessed valuation, they will see an increase to the fire departments. Member Caisley stated the following: I think this is a win/win situation because each of these wind turbines is worth one million and three quarter dollars. Chairman Sweeney stated the following: you are testifying again Mr. Hug stated the following: that was in the record. There was talk of the value of the towers. Member Caisley stated the following: each of them are worth $1,750,000 which they would have invested and this would protect their investment as well as protect those in the vicinity of the wind farm. Chairman Sweeney stated that there was an amendment on the floor and asked for a roll call vote with the Chairman voting. Clerk Milton shows the roll call vote as follows: Butler-no; Caisley-yes; Cavallini-no; Dean-yes; Gordon-no; Hoselton-no; Moss-no; Nuckolls-no; Owens-no; Rackauskas-no; Renner-no; Segobiano-no; Selzer-no; Sorensen-no; Ahart-no; Baggett-no; Bostic-yes; and Sweeney-no. Motion defeated 15-3. Chairman Sweeney stated the following: now we are going back to the main motion. Is there any discussion? Member Renner stated the following: what we have here is a situation that we are really not talking about wind energy. I think most of us are in favor of wind energy. I also think it would be a great idea to have quite a few wind farms in McLean County. The question is does this particular location meet all of the seven criteria. I have questions about one of them but I feel it unnecessary to focus on that because there is one that is clearly\n",
      "167\n",
      "not met. I don't see from the evidence how we can reasonably conclude that nobody will be harmed by this. By harmed I mean in terms of property values; not immediately the people who are on the wind turbines but the community of Carlock. What we have is evidence presented that suggests that on a national basis wind farms do not have a harmful effect upon the property values of the residents around it but the vast majority of wind farms through out the US are situated similarly to southeastern McLean County, in lightly populated areas not near a community that has several hundred residents. I don't know if a $150,000 home would go down to $120,000. ifthe $150,000 home levels off, declines slightly, or takes 60-90 days longer to sell, to me that is harm. I don't see any evidence in the record that allows me to determine that no one will be harmed by this project. That is why I believe that criterion is not met. Member Cavallini stated the following: I had the opportunity to attend the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs in Peoria and they had a panel presentation looking at wind farms. They had invited a representative from N avitas, the company that built the wind farm by Interstate 39. One of the things that I learned from him was that Navitas offers what they refer to as a home protection plan so that in the like property values would decline N avitas would stand behind that, and under this plan there is an insurance policy for the property owners in that area who thought they might be impacted negatively by the construction of the wind farm. Maybe this is something that Inv Energy needs to look into and talk with representatives of Navitas to see what their specific plan involves. Maybe this is something that could be offered to the homeowners in this Carlock area and could eliminate some of the fear. There is one side of the research that says there is no decline and the other side says there is decline. The company obviously is saying it doesn't decline. If they feel that strongly about it, maybe a home protection plan should be offered. I would like to see an updated map. I would like to see what 39 wind turbines are being taken out of this equation. I would also like to see a map that juxtaposes the 100 wind turbines and places them in relationship to homes. I took some time to drive out to look at Sunset Lake to try to analyze the area. It is in District 1 and my wife and I had this map we tried to figure out where in relationship to homes this would be and it was very difficult to determine. I would suggest we get an updated map from the company showing us which turbines are going to be eliminated, which ones will be left, and where they in relationship to the homes that are there? Chairman Sweeney asked if there was any other discussion. No requests were made at that time. He then asked for a roll call vote with the Chairman voting. Clerk Milton shows the roll call vote as follows: Butler-yes; Caisley-yes; Cavallini-yes; Dean-yes; Gordon-yes; Hoselton-yes; Moss-yes; Nuckolls-yes; Owens-yes; Rackauskas-yes; Renner-no; Segobiano-yes; Selzer-yes; Sorensen-yes; Ahart-yes; Baggett-yes; Bostic-yes; and Sweeney-yes.

      "In our January 11 meeting and our subsequent discussions, you have described your interest in two related issues:\n",
      "1. Does your office have the proper number of employees? 2. Are there changes in process that would make your staff more productive?\n",
      "This is our proposal to assist you with such a review.\n",
      "We cannot promise what our analysis would find. Our first impression is that your office has a good level of productivity compared to other central Illinois counties of similar size. That is not an endorsement that other offices are as productive as they could be.\n",
      "Upon taking office, your established a workflow that has staff specialize in different aspects of the recording process. Formerly, each employee would grab a stack of documents from the in-box and perform all aspects of the recording process for a single document, from start to finish. Now, the work process is divided into steps performed by different people.\n",
      "You also commenced testing for error rates in documents recorded. This work, performed pro bono by a local professor, is a key step in any quality control process. We will describe below how our analysis may learn from the results of that effort and how we may pose questions that would help you refine your quality control processes. We turn now to a description of the work we would do.\n",
      "We should test whether process changes could enhance productivity before testing if your office has the correct number of employees.\n",

      "Decomposing and Mapping the Recording Process\n",
      "\"Recording\" is actually several processes (imaging, verifying, indexing, etc.) performed on different types of documents. We have to decompose the work flow to see where bottlenecks may arise and how to fix them. We do not propose separate flow charts for each type of recording.\n",
      "We need to determine:\n",
      "The basic steps of the recording process • The time required by each stage in the recording process (i.e., does each step require an identical amount of time exactly matched to the current division of responsibilities by employee?\n",
      "We will develop the process map through direct observation and interviews. We intend to ask staff if document flow \"bunches up\" at one person's desk and if so, where. We will also ask if these bottlenecks occur randomly or at predictable points in the process. Finally, we ask for suggestions for improvements.\n",
      "We will flow chart at a high level, drilling down to more detail if that helps explain impediments to the smooth and efficient flow of documents. There is no purpose served by detailing where delays are not occurring. The flow charting should help detect where assignments may need to be balanced. We will supplement the flow chart with a table showing time and cost required by each stage of the recording process. The flow chart and table will need \"as is\" and \"to be\" versions, so that we can work with you to explore possible improvements.\n",
      "After you validate the accuracy of the \"as is\" process map, we will meet with you to discuss implications and ideas for streamlining, which will result in a \"to be\" process map. After you approve a ''to be\" version, we will develop a change plan with you. This may involve a discussion with your software vendor. Not knowing what the options and choices might be, we cannot include the actual change effort as part of this proposal. If you wish our help with change management, we would discuss arrangements for our role in that process at that time.\n",
      "We cannot predict the implications of this analysis, but they may include:\n",
      "• Not having the right people assigned to specific parts of the process (i.e., recruiting I training I supervision issues)\n",
      "Insufficient number of employees\n",
      "Suboptimal division of responsibilities (i.e., the points at which a document passes from one person to another)\n",
      "193\n",
      "Proposal to Review Recorder's Office Staffing and Process Page3\n",
      "Physical layout of desks and document flow • A need for better documentation of procedures and/or quality control\n",
      "Quality Assurance\n",
      "Quality assurance is critical to recording, both to ensure the integrity of County records and to avoid the cost of rework. In many organizations, the cost/benefit implications of quality assurance are fuzzy, leading to efforts that may be inadequate or excessive. Our effort is not intended to quantify the cost/benefit of QA effort, but to help provide direction to your ongoing QA efforts.\n",
      "Your principal quality control effort is double entry of forms. This is probably the single most important effort for preventing errors from entering the County's records. Even so, additional safeguards may increase your confidence that the process has the integrity that you desire.\n",
      "To further this goal, you have enlisted the aid of a local professor to determine error rates in the recording process. We applaud this process, but may suggest improvements.\n",
      "If it were possible to test each stage of the process for errors, you would learn a great deal about staffing, training and the need for formal quality assurance procedures. lt seems unlikely that all employees are equally trained, productive and accurate. Unless you can determine where your process is vulnerable, you will not be able to pinpoint where to intervene.\n",
      "We could provide statistical analysis of your error rates if you wished, but since you have arranged for these services at no cost to the County, we assume that you would not wish for us to do that.\n",
      "Our review of quality procedures would include:\n",
      "A review of the background and training of each employee, with an eye to suggestions that may smooth the transition of work between staff of varying levels of experience and productivity\n",
      "A review of the documentation of work process provided by your office and your software vendor, with the intent of addressing whether the effort is sufficient\n",
      "You indicated two non-County employees whose views of the office you felt it important for us to hear. We will interview them after they prepare a summary of their observations in writing for us. We require this written summary prior to those interviews in order to limit the cost of providing our services.\n",
      "194\n",
      "Proposal to Review Recorder's Office Staffing and Process Page4\n",
      "Deliverables\n",
      "Our report will contain the following elements that will assist the County both in addressing the current situation and in managing future efforts.\n",
      "A benchmark table of staffing, workload, square footage and systems vs. comparable Central Illinois counties. This will not update itself automatically, but it will be relatively easy for the Recorder's Office to maintain by periodic contacts with peer offices. ·\n",
      "Job descriptions from a peer county and a table showing our assessment of current Mclean County Recorder's Office staff in comparison.\n",
      "A \"to do\" list that we will triage into immediate, current year and longer term categories, which you may, of course, decide to realign by your personal priorities. At this point, we cannot predict our findings, but\n",
      "Work Plan\n",
      "This work breakdown structure shows the hours that we plan to spend in each step of the project. Our work would be a firm fixed price effort, which requires that our effort to assist also have a firm fixed limit. You may request change orders, but we are not assuming that you will.\n",
      "You indicated that you would expect approval of the project (if given) by late February 2007 and would require a final report by June 1, to give time to incorporate any recommendations in the upcoming year's budget.\n",

      "Chairman Sweeney stated the following: we lost a very valuable Member of the County Board a few days ago. He was Chairman of the Transportation Committee from December 1994 to March 2007. He also served with the Intergovernmental Agreement with the Airport Authority for Towanda-Barnes Road. He was involved in the East Side Highway Feasibility Study and Corridor Study. He was also assisted with the jurisdictional transfer between the City of Bloomington and the County and between the Town of Normal and the County. He was involved in the Purchase of Land on Route 9 East for use by the County Highway Department. He served as Chairman of the Land Use and Development Committee from December of 1992 until December of 1994. He was also a Member of the following Board Committees: Executive Committee from December 1992 through March 2007; Justice Committee from December of 1986 through December of 1988; Land Use and Development Committee from December 1988 through December 1990; Transportation Committee from December 1984 through December 1990; Property and Recreation Committee form July 1979 through December 1984 and December 1988 through December 1990; Health Committee from July 1979 through December 1982; arid Rules Committee from December 1996 through December 1998. I could go through the years but I think that Member Segobiano has a much better understanding of all the things Member Bass ;was involved in because he is now the oldest living Member of the County Board. I am sure you have some things to say. Member Segobiano stated the following: it is rather difficult to put into a few words for someone you have known for almost 50 years. I have known him all of my life as Duffy and I thought at some point in time he should be referred to as Mr. Bass because that is exactly what he was, Mr. Bass. To go back in history we had recently had an appointment for a vacancy here and I think it was the right one and we will be malting one for Mr. Bass's replacement and for a man who has given so much to this community, had to endure about three or four votes, and sat, as a very patient man, in the back of the old courthouse and endured the conversation and the bickering that went back and forth and we prevailed and Duffy was appointed to the Board. To this day I believe we made the right choice for the citizens of McLean County but going back and remembering Duffy more so as coach and community leader. For those of you know where O'Neil Park, we raised our kids at O'Neil Park. I can envision Duffy Bass being in right field and at home plate working with eight and nine year old kids. TI1en into high school and college and later with the County's program One thing about Mr. Bass I think we need to realize our future lies in our youth and he always had time for kids. I will always remember Mr. Bass being in right field because one of those ldds was my son who had the opportunity to play for Mr. Bass. When we have an opportunity to help a child, think back about what that child will benefit from the constructive help and instructions whatever they might\n",
      "224\n",
      "be. I think a good example is when the federal judge stood up at his funeral and recollected what Duffy had done for him. We will miss you our dear friend; I will miss you at O'Neil Park and I hope whomever we replace him with will bring the same attitude, community spirit, and humor he shared with us Member Hoselton stated the following: I'm going down a different road. I met Duffy over 50 years ago when he was assistant coach at ISNU. Even in those early days of coaching and teaching Duffy was respected by all his players and the faculty. Duffy Bass's name came up more than once regarding how he could help young people out and he always answered that call. Through the years I would run into him but he always remembered me and everybody else. It always amazed me. When I was elected to this Board, Duffy called me, congratulated me, and said he'd see me at the Board meeting, At that very first meeting, Duffy led me to the chair next to him, where I am seated today and he quickly explained that I was to listen and not speak for two years. This lasted until the next meeting and I was told that I didn't follow instructions and that wasn't bad for a guy from Chenoa. I was appointed to his Transportation Committee and if I needed advice or information I could call him and he quickly became more than a helper. He became a good friend. One day prior to a meeting, Duffy and I were jabbing at each other about our home towns. He was from Toluca but I never held that against him and I asked him, what do they have besides two great restaurants and he looked at me as if I were brain-dead and said bocce ball. He then went into great detail about the game. Everybody had a court in their back yard, he told me. Whatever my reply was, it sure got his attention because we didn't talk about home town or bocce ball for a couple of weeks. Then at the next Board meeting, I had to go to a standup. Duff remained seated and as I returned he pulled my chair out and I started to sit down and he placed what he said was a bocce ball in my seat, which was very uncomfortable. !jumped up, he grabbed the ball, looked me square in the eye and said ''bocce ball.\" I told him that those guys in Toluca had a unique way in which they served. We both laughed at that and it was the last game ofbocce ball I ever played. Readers Digest had a section called \"The Most Unforgettable Character I Ever Met.\" Duffy Bass is my nominee. We all, at some time in our lives, meet a person we just marvel at, one you wish you could be like but you know full well that you can't be and you never will. Duffy Bass was one of those people. He could just roll. He could meet the Pope and talk the Pope into something. Could it be his smile or that little bounce in his walk, his quick wit, or that look in his eye? Maybe it was the way he held his hands. I used to marvel at the meetings about the very pious way he held. How could he know when and how to say the right thing? He always said the right thing and he was a forgiving person - if he agreed with you, but disagreement by him was so subtle that you would find yourself agreeing with him. All in all he was a most unique person. He had an attitude about life, friends, and family that clearly defined him. That is why I will truly miss him.\n",

      "Apex Clean Energy said the project, called Diamond Grove Wind, is in the early stages of development. Public engagement manager Max Jabrixio told The Pantagraph that the project would take up about 30,000 acres of farmland between LeRoy and Heyworth.\n",
      "He said the company is talking with roughly 100 homeowners in the area.\n",
      "“There is so much active wind in the county already and our conversation with the homeowners has been overwhelmingly positive because they already know how useful wind energy has been there,” Jabrixio said.\n",
      "The timeline for the project has not yet been finalized, Jabrixio said, but Apex anticipates that construction could start in early 2024 and be completed by the end of that year.\n",

      "“We’ve begun early conversations with landowners and farmers regarding their interest in the project and have received a very positive response,\" Senior Development Manager Alan Moore said in a statement. \"Many residents are already familiar with the benefits of wind energy given McLean’s role as a leader in bringing projects like this to the region.”\n",

      "The eatery is an octogenarian now, begun in 1936 by immigrant brothers Fred and John Baldini near the end of the Great Depression.\n",
      "Over time, many superlatives have described its special ambiance: painted tin ceilings, a working dumbwaiter and Lilliputian-sized bathrooms. “A delightful old-time saloon” gushed The New York Times; “one of the most congenial bars ever founded,” fawned The Washington Post.\n",
      "Its long love affair with Democrats was trumpeted by John Baldini No. 2, revered leader of McLean County’s liberal wing until his 1994 death. The grill dispenses Kennedy half-dollars in change and one manager – John Fitzgerald Koch – is even named for the 35th president.\n",
      "Oodles of celebrities have walked through the doors but it’s regulars and folks like 46-year employee Lois Durbin who have been vetted with a picture on the wall or a plaque on a barstool or a menu item named in their honor.\n",

      "It’s also among the most populous, called home each year by about 2,200 students.\n",
      "Arthur W. Watterson was not a major financial donor to the university, the primary way people and corporations get their names on buildings these days.\n",
      "Instead, Watterson was a geography professor who died in 1966, a year before construction began on the 28-story building. He had joined the ISU faculty in 1946, after serving in the Office of War Information in Washington and later with the Office of Strategic Services, mostly in Europe, during World War II.\n",
      "He led the geography department for 15 years, from 1951 to 1966.\n",
      "Selected in 1961 for the Outstanding Citizen Award by the Normal Chamber of Commerce, he was described as a “tireless worker on the ISU campus, in his church and in his community.”\n",
      "His name - rescued from relative obscurity - isn’t the only one attached to the residence complex.\n",

      "The brother and brother-in-law grow corn and soybeans, just as our dads did. They plant seeds in the darkest, richest, most fertile ground you’ll find … the brother in Logan, McLean and Tazewell counties, the brother in-law in Hancock and Henderson to the west.\n",
      "They worry about rain or the lack of it. They fret about wind or hail or droughts. They take out their pocket knives and dig in the dirt. All the while, they know there is no better place to raise a crop.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "“I would say it’s the fact we have a deeper top soil than a lot of other parts of the country that grow crops,” the brother said. “That probably helps us as much as anything. The top soil is really rich and productive.\n",
      "“We’re flat here, we have a lot of top soil and our soil drains fairly well, but it also retains water very well. Moisture seems to be readily available to the crop most of the time because it’s not draining away real quickly, yet it is draining.”\n",

      "Dan Craft | dcraft@pantagraph.com\n",
      "There’s nothing remotely normal about the 80-year-old Normal Theater: the sleek Art Deco/Art Moderne building at 209 North St. remains among Illinois’ handful of surviving, still-functioning single-screen bijous.\n",
      "It was designed by famed Bloomington architect Arthur F. Moratz and financed to the tune of $100,000 by local lawyer Sylvan Kupfer, who leased the theater to Great States Corp.\n",
      "The first of Hollywood’s movie legends to visit the Normal’s silver screen: Bing Crosby, whose new musical comedy, “Double or Nothing,” graced the marquee on opening night in 1937.\n",
      "Crosby remains a Normal fixture thanks to the annual showings of his seasonal classics “White Christmas” and “Holiday Inn.”\n",
      "Among the Normal’s distinctions: It was the first B-N cinema designed for sound movies and it was equipped with air conditioning, a rarity for 1937.\n",
      "There was rough sledding ahead as the movie business changed, reaching a nadir in 1985, when its then-owner shoved a wall between the balcony and the main floor to create a cramped twin-screen theater.\n",
      "The ploy failed and the theater closed in 1991, reduced to seedy second-run, bargain house status.\n",
      "Salvation and rebirth came via the Town of Normal, which purchased the theater and committed to a meticulous three-year restoration that included a return to its single-screen origins.\n",
      "The grand re-opening occurred Oct. 7, 1994, with “Singin’ in the Rain.” In the two decades since, the theater has remained an iconic symbol and focal point of uptown renaissance.\n",

      "Thus, the packed parking lots at Avanti’s in Normal and Tobin’s Pizza in Bloomington when former ISU and IWU students roll into town.\n",
      "The Avanti’s on Main Street near the ISU campus may have changed some inside since it was opened by Guido and Albert Zeller in 1971. What hasn’t changed is Avanti’s fresh Italian bread, which is prepared and baked in the restaurant’s kitchen and, of course, the trademark “Avanti’s famous gondola” of ham, salami, American cheese and lettuce.\n",
      "You can get a half gondola, but a whole gondola is usually the way to go for hearty eaters. There are plenty of other options on the menu, but the gondola always is the first remembered.\n",
      "South from Avanti’s, on Main Street near the IWU campus, sits Tobin’s Pizza, a community staple since 1963 when Jim Tobin opened the doors. It looks almost the same inside as 1963, too, which just adds to its unique charm.\n",
      "The thin (but not paper thin) crust pizza has remained the same even after Moe and Karen Davis bought the business in 1998. “If it isn’t broke, don’t fix it,” said Moe Davis on the 50th anniversary in 2013.\n",

      "That’s where Lincoln also crossed paths with Adlai Stevenson I, the first in a succession of Democrat office-holders with the same last name.\n",
      "So impressed with Lincoln were Davis and several other prominent local leaders that they provided the support Lincoln needed in May 1860 to secure the Republican presidential nomination.\n",
      "After Lincoln was elected, Davis was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he remained until he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1877.\n",
      "Stevenson, who had moved to Bloomington with his family when he was 16, later served as vice president under Grover Cleveland and in the U.S. Congress.\n",
      "The second Stevenson named Adlai (grandson of Adlai I) was governor of Illinois, a presidential candidate and a U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. His son, Adlai III, was a U.S. senator and candidate for governor.\n",

      "People came from all over to drink it.\n",
      "That’s when, as an added attraction to make people thirstier, Shirk went into a back room at his restaurant and poured a special glaze onto a baking platter of unskinned Virginia-grown peanuts.\n",

      "The chain restaurant, which includes a sit-down dining room and drive-through lanes, was founded in 1934 in the Twin Cities.\n",
      "Gus Belt opened the first Steak ’n Shake at Main Street and Virginia Avenue (now home to Monical’s Pizza), after he added food to a Shell service station line-up of gasoline, tires and turtleburgers.\n",
      "A finicky Belt ground the steak by hand, in front of his customers, charging 20 cents and a penny tax for a burger and shake. He didn’t like either item, yet mandated a pickle with every bite — which is why you still get two long slices on each steakburger.\n",
      "Along the way, he also coined (and trademarked) the term “cheeseburger” and determined the secret to good chili is a hint of cocoa.\n",
      "He and his wife Edith bought the former Maplewood Country Club property in 1940 and used the land to pasture cows. In 1953, the acreage was platted into Maplewood subdivision, which fronts Jersey Avenue. Belt Avenue is named in his honor.\n",

      "Since 1891, when the city of Bloomington began allocating funds for the care of animals at Miller Park, the zoo established there has been home to a wide variety of critters from all corners of the globe.\n",
      "“We’ve had animals from from every continent on earth except for Antarctica,” said Miller Park Zoo Superintendent Jay Tetzloff.\n",
      "Many of the zoo’s earliest denizens were housed at the Koetthoefer Animal Building, a structure that opened to the public 100 years ago and was designed by renowned Bloomington architect A.L. Pillsbury. The building is still in use today and is a site for daily feedings, a popular attraction of the venerable facility.\n",
      "The zoo was expanded in 1960 and grew exponentially in the 1990s after the Entrance Building/Education Center opened in 1992.\n",

      "“My theory is that we can do more and tell a story better in four hours than churches can in several months,” said Wally Crouch of Normal, who has been business manager for the play for the past 10 years and associated with the play for more than 35.\n",
      "The play, staged every spring at Bloomington Center for the Performing Arts, presents the story of Jesus in 11 performances that begin with the beheading of John the Baptist and end with Christ’s ascension. About 230 characters participate in 56 scenes. The play is directed by J. Garrie Burr and codirected by John Capasso. The actors are non-professionals with a spiritual dedication to their parts.\n",
      "“It’s the people that make the play special,” Crouch said. “Some have been acting in it for 60 years and we have had several generations of the same families as actors.”\n",

      "While other local watering holes have their devotees, none can match the longevity of Pub II, which received one of the first liquor licenses after Normal ended its self-imposed prohibition in 1974.\n",

      "Many believe to this day he actually earned a gold.\n",
      "The former Illinois State All-American was a central figure in perhaps the most controversial moment in Olympic history as a member of the United States basketball team.\n",
      "Collins sank two free throws with three seconds remaining to give the Amercans a 50-49 lead in the gold medal game against the Soviet Union.\n",
      "The Soviets inbounded the ball and the clock hit zero only to have time put back on the clock after a claim that a timeout had been called. Time ran out again as the Soviets failed to score, but they were given a third chance when it was decided by an international basketball official that a timing error had been made.\n",
      "On the third attempt, Alexander Belov turned a long pass into a game-winning shot.\n",
      "Collins and the rest of the U.S. team, who had celebrated victory twice, were devastated and steadfastly refuse to accept the silver medal more than 40 years later. A silver medal that holds considerably better memories belongs to former University High School volleyball star Ogonna Nnamani.\n",
      "Nnamani, who also enjoyed an All-American career at Stanford, was part of the American women’s volleyball team that competed in Athens, Greece, in 2004 before earning a silver medal in 2008 at Beijing, China.\n",

Throughout the summer, crowds congregate there day and night, offering frosty balm to sooth nerves seared by a hot summer day or the incentive to put on walking shoes or ride a bike to reach nirvana.\n",
      "Family nights out or get-togethers with friends are often capped off there.\n",

      "“It was a way of life and I loved it there,” said Chester Henry, a retired Illinois State Police trooper who for more than 25 years patrolled the “Mother Road” around Bloomington-Normal. Highways then, said Chester, were a much more personal, friendly place and he knew all the great places to dine, sleep and take a break.\n",

      "During the election of 1900 — Democrat William Jennings Bryan and running mate Bloomington’s Adlai E. Stevenson I ran against Republicans William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt — The Pantagraph hung a large canvas on a building across Madison Street and used a stereopticon machine to project running vote totals.\n",

      "BroMenn’s history at its current site began when Deaconess Hospital opened May 8, 1896, on eight acres between Bloomington and Normal. The name changed in 1901 after Abram Brokaw, a wealthy plowmaker, made a $10,000 contribution. A nursing school was established at that time.\n",
      "In 1984, Brokaw Hospital merged with Mennonite Hospital in Bloomington and Eureka Hospital to form BroMenn Healthcare. A major expansion in 1991 turned Brokaw into BroMenn Regional Medical Center; Mennonite became BroMenn Lifecare Center but closed in the late 1990s.\n",
      "A merger with Oak Brook-based Advocate Health Care in 2010 resulted in Advocate BroMenn Medical Center (and Advocate Eureka Hospital). A 136,000-square-foot addition opened in 2012, giving the facility 221 beds.\n",
      "St. Joseph’s Hospital was opened in 1880 on Jackson Street in Bloomington. The hospital moved to East Washington Street in 1968 and is now part of OSF HealthCare System. OSF St. Joseph Medical Center is a 149-bed notfor-profit acute care facility and level II trauma center.\n",

      "And, that trend seems certain to continue.\n",
      "Built in 1916 by Charles U. Williams, the current Castle not only housed the 1,000-seat theater but also accommodated storage for his adjacent auto dealership, with a freight elevator that carried cars to the upper floors.\n",
      "But the prospect of the Castle seeing its 100th anniversary seemed highly remote when GKC Theaters shuttered the cinema in 1988. As the building remained dormant through the ‘90s, a plan to make the Castle one of the centerpieces in Bloomington’s cultural district gained momentum.\n",
      "Following a $1.5 million renovation, the theater reopened in 2003 as a film house featuring couch seating and beer on tap. That incarnation lasted just three years as the Castle was shuttered again, although Clearview Christian Church continued to hold services there.\n",

      "Among the Kickapoo who attended that first homecoming powwow was Margarita Salazar, then 104, who said through an interpreter, “All our grandmothers lived here. …I feel good over it, that I can be around where my ancestors once roamed.”\n",
      "The one-acre Grand Village of the Kickapoo Park was dedicated during the powwow and buffalo were returned to roam. Powwows have taken place periodically since then. The most recent was Sept. 9 and 10.\n",
      "Davis mansion was focus of Twin City Victorian era\n",
      "KEVIN BARLOW | KBARLOW@pantagraph.com\n",
      "Just a few blocks east of downtown Bloomington sits a three-story, 36-room Victorian mansion made of yellow brick.\n",
      "If those walls could talk, oh what stories they could tell.\n",
      "David Davis Mansion State Historic Site was the residence of Sarah and David Davis, who were at the center of American politics and society. He rode the circuit with Abraham Lincoln, was a U.S. senator and eventually Supreme Court justice from 1862 to 1877.\n",
      "The house, its garden and five outbuildings remained in the Davis family until 1960, when the buildings and 4.1 acres were donated to the state of Illinois. From 1990 until April 2014, Marcia Young was the site manager.\n",
      "“It really takes a lot of people working together to keep this going, but we have had a lot of great people helping us out over the years,” she said.\n",
      "The home is open to the general public from Wednesday through Saturday and hosts several seasonal events. During the winter, the mansion is lavishly decorated for the Christmas holiday. Gaslight tours are offered during December.\n",
      "Inside the mansion is a collection of mid-19th century decorative arts and technological conveniences, illustrating the life of a prosperous Victorian-era family.\n",
      "The mansion is located at 1000 Monroe Drive; tours are available every half hour from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday.\n",
      "Tours start with a 17-minute video; tours last about 45 minutes.\n",
      "Third Sunday Market a longtime Twin City tradition\n",
      "KEVIN BARLOW | KBARLOW@pantagraph.com\n",
      "It’s not hard to figure out when the Third Sunday Market is.\n",
      "For 29 years, the monthly flea market has brought thousands of customers and vendors to the grounds of the Interstate Center in Bloomington on the third Sunday of May through October.\n",
      "Don and Carol Raycraft started the market in 1988 and continues as a family business. What began as a hobby with just a handful of vendors and a few hundred customers has grown to more than 450 vendors from at least 17 states who want to sell antiques, collectibles or assorted items.\n",
      "“Collecting is a disease, but it’s better than drinking or womanizing,” said vendor Andy Magnafici of LaSalle.\n",
      "General manager Mike Raycraft, son of Don and Carol, says the market continues to be a family-oriented business.\n",
      "“Many of our employees have been here for more than two decades,” he said. “Everyone knows their job and knows it well.”\n",
      "Many of the vendors have been there just as long.\n",
      "“We have had customers that have turned into vendors to support their collecting habit,” Raycraft said.\n",
      "The indoor/outdoor sale features a little bit of everything, from the finest in antique furniture to folk art, vintage advertising, sports memorabilia, antique linens and clothing.\n",
      "Occasional special shows are scheduled during the fall and winter months as well, Raycraft said.\n",
      "CIRA, Bloomington-Normal have grown up together\n",
      "ROGER MILLER | RMILLER@pantagraph.com\n",
      "In the 1950s, an Ozark DC-3 made so many stops between Bloomington and St. Louis that an airport leader joked it was faster to drive.\n",
      "Today the airport has six nonstop destinations — Atlanta, Minneapolis, Chicago, Dallas, Orlando and Tampa. In 2015, it also added a FedEx facility with daily 757 flights handling more than 12 million pounds of cargo annually.\n",
      "“CIRA is an integral part of the fabric of the Bloomington-Normal community. We actually grew up together,” said Carl Olson, the airport’s executive director.\n",
      "There was an airfield north of Normal in the late 1920s, but local aviation took off with the opening of Bloomington Municipal Airport in 1934. Commercial passenger service began Nov. 6, 1950, when Ozark Air Lines added the city to the Moline-Peoria-Champaign-Danville-Indianapolis run.\n",
      "The Bloomington-Normal Airport Authority was established in 1964, a year that saw 8,485 passengers (the number of fliers topped 579,265 in 2011). The 1960s and ‘70s saw a new runway, terminal, control tower and flights to Chicago.\n",
      "The 1980s and early 1990s added airlines and service to Detroit, but 1996 was the turning point. That’s when the longer Runway 2/20 opened, attracting AirTran Airways’ full-size jet service to Florida and Atlanta, Ga., and necessitating a $40 million terminal project, completed in 2001.\n",
      "CIRA has weathered airline changes, post-Sept. 11 rules, the Great Recession and swings in passenger numbers, but as former authority board Chairman Neale McCormick said, “It has grown from a ‘hobby’ airport into something Bloomington-Normal can be proud of.”\n",
      "Beich’s sweet career started in downtown Bloomington\n",
      "karen hansen | khansen@pantagraph.com\n",
      "Paul F. Beich made Bloomington a sweeter place.\n",
      "Beich founded a sugar-coated dynasty that included such timeless confections as Laffy Taffy, Katydids and Golden Clusters. Sweet success started with hard work as an immigrant teen at a downtown Bloomington confectionery begun in 1854 by J.L. Green, a stint as a traveling salesman for a St. Louis candy company, and a return to Bloomington to buy the candy store of his youth.\n",
      "Beich and a partner convinced candy czar Milton Hershey to move manufacturing for his Lancaster Caramel Co. from Chicago to a vacant buggy factory at Front and Lumber streets. By about 1905, the two partners were gone and Beich was running the Paul F. Beich Candy Co. Soon it had hundreds of employees.\n",
      "In the 1920s, Beich’s sold chocolate-peanut-marshmallow bars touted as “Whiz – Best nickel candy there iz-z.” Its nutritional survival bars were given to soldiers and astronauts. In 1967, another factory on the city’s southwest side opened; it’s still used today.\n",
      "Beich’s descendants remained at the helm until the business was sold to Nestle in 1984. Later, Nestle sold the Kathryn Beich fundraising arm.\n",
      "In June, Nestle said it's considering “strategic options” that could include the sale of its U.S. confectionery business, including its southwest Bloomington factory.\n",
      "The west-side factory was destroyed in a 2005 fire, shortly before a planned demolition. Afterward, great-grandson David Beich wrote a letter in tribute:\n",
      "“The building refused to die by the wrecking ball, instead waiting for the right moment in time to display her glory and die a dignified death,” he said.\n",
      "But melt-in-your-mouth memories live on.\n",

      "Two wind energy companies have failed to set up agreements with McLean County government to set aside money to protect nearby landowners for wind farm decommissioning, according to County Board Chair John McIntyre.\n",
      "McIntyre announced during Thursday’s monthly county board meeting the states attorney’s office is making “considerable progress” in talks with EDP Renewables and Invenergy to establish escrow accounts.\n",
      "Houston-based EDP started the High Trail Wind Farm and Old Trail Wind Farm, both near Ellsworth, in 2007, along with the more recent Bright Stalk Wind Farm near Chenoa. Chicago-based Invenergy built the White Oak Wind Farm near Carlock which went online in 2011. Invenergy sold that wind farm to White Oak Wind Energy. Invenergy also operates the Blooming Grove Wind Farm in northeast McLean County that started producing energy in 2021, and the company is building the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm near Bellflower.\n",
      "County administrator Cassy Taylor said county staff is working with Invenergy on a decommissioning agreement that is not overdue.\n",
      "McIntyre said the county’s special use permits for the projects require the wind farm companies pay $25,000 per wind tower into an escrow fund to cover any additional costs associated with site restoration once the wind turbines are no longer in use.\n",
      "County officials did not say how much money the companies owed the county. The funds were to be established after 12 years in operation.\n",
      "“McLean County has always been known for honorably fulfilling our end of the contract and we expect all other companies to do likewise,” McIntyre told the board, adding if there’s no resolution by March 16, he will bring the matter back to the board to take action.\n",
      "“It’s time. Enough is enough. We need to get this done,” McIntyre said.\n",
      "Representatives for EDP and Invenergy were not immediately available for comment.\n",
      "In other business, the county board:\n",
      "Approved a preliminary plan by Tom Kirk from Henson Disposal for the HDI subdivision on 44 acres at 2148 Tri Lakes Road in Bloomington Township. Kirk plans to seek permitting for a municipal waste transfer station on the property that already processes construction, demolition and green waste. Kirk said the project is estimated to cost nearly $5 million, adding the station likely will help bring down municipal waste costs for municipalities by offering competition.\n",
      "OK'd a $2.8 million bid from Stark Excavating for the Hoffman Bridge project on Colfax Road (CH 13).\n",
      "Approved a $1.5 million contract with Arthur J. Gallagher Risk Management Services. That marks a 17% increase over the county’s current insurance plan. County staff attribute the increase to less competition in the insurance market, along with inflationary pressures.\n",
      "Adopted an agreement for the McLean County Sheriff’s Office to provide police patrols in the city of Lexington through the end of the year. According to county staff, the Lexington Police Department is reorganizing and needs up to 40 hours of additional coverage. Lexington will pay $85 per hour for deputy patrols.\n",
      "Approved a resolution of congratulations for longtime labor and Democratic Party leader John Penn on his retirement. County Board members gave Penn a standing ovation.\n",
      "Corrected: February 22, 2023 at 9:01 AM CST\n",
      "WGLT initially reported a county agreement with Invenergy was overdue. County administration later indicated Invenergy was not overdue in establishing a decommissioning agreement.\n"
