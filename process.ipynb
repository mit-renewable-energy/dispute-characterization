      "Bad energy? This field would be covered in rows of solar panels if the proposed Bonanza Energy Facility comes to fruition. Photo by Alex Schwatrz/Herald and News\n",
      "By Alex Schwartz, (Klamath Falls) Herald and New. November 16, 2020. Hecate Energy LLC hopes to take advantage of the Klamath Basin’s 300-plus days of sun per year by constructing the Bonanza Energy Facility. Rows of photovoltaic panels spanning up to 1,851 acres would convert sunlight into electrical energy, which would be sent via transmission line to the Captain Jack Substation north of Malin, Oregon. From there it would enter the California-Oregon Intertie, an electricity superhighway that transports power between California and the Pacific Northwest.\n",
      "Utilities like Pacific Power and Portland General Electric would have the ability to purchase the electricity through energy markets.\n",
      "The facility would generate between 150 and 300 megawatts of carbon-free power. An accompanying battery system housed in 11 separate buildings could store up to 1,100 megawatts of energy to make up for Klamath County’s rare cloudy days.\n",
      "Hecate submitted a Notice of Intent to Apply for a site certificate to the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council in August, the first step in a long state approval process for the facility. The notice isn’t a formal application and therefore doesn’t include many specifics about the project’s construction or operations, but some Bonanza residents aren’t enthused about what they’re seeing so far.\n",
      "The proposed site is currently a ranch in the heart of Langell Valley, bordering the Lost River to the northeast and surrounding Dead Indian Hill. The 2,733-acre property is currently zoned for exclusive farm use. Farmers and ranchers have called the area home for more than 100 years, enjoying picturesque views, wildlife and a rural lifestyle.\n",
      "Neighbors surround the sprawling ranch, which is also home to wetland areas and migrating deer habitat.\n",
      "The site has changed owners several times over the past couple decades, but another company had successfully acquired a permit there to construct the California Oregon Border Energy Facility, a gas-fired power plant. That was in 2006 before California’s energy prices tanked the region’s gas market.\n",
      "“The view is going to be atrocious. Instead of seeing cattle grazing they’re going to see an eight-foot chain-link fence and solar panels.”\n",
      "The site’s potential new life as a solar farm is indicative of the West Coast’s economic and political shift from fossil fuels to renewables.\n",
      "Paul Turner, senior vice president of business development for Hecate Energy LLC, said the fact that another energy project had been able to receive a permit for that site was the reason Hecate chose it for the Bonanza Energy Facility. He added that the company has not considered other sites in the area for the solar facility.\n",
      "Hecate has not yet purchased the property from its current landowner but has negotiated an exclusive long-term option to do so later in the permitting process.\n",
      "“It’s still a great location for access to wholesale electricity markets along the West Coast,” Turner said.\n",
      "Views, wildlife affected\n",
      "When Maureen Thomas looked out beyond the border of the property she’s lived on with her husband for 25 years, she imagined solar panels covering the fields to the west. She didn’t like the prospect.\n",
      "“I don’t understand how they can take productive agricultural land and turn it into an industrial park,” Thomas said.\n",
      "Thomas and her neighbors said being bordered by a vast field of solar panels could devalue their properties.\n",
      "“The view is going to be atrocious,” said Liz Hubbard, who lives down the road. “Instead of seeing cattle grazing on pasture, wetlands and deer, they’re going to see an eight-foot chain-link fence and solar panels.”\n",
      "Resident concern: The proposed site for the facility is near an important area for sandhill cranes. Photo by Mikul/Wikimedia Commons\n",
      "Residents said the area surrounding Dead Indian Hill is also a popular spot for migrating and fawning deer in the fall and spring. Previous solar projects in Klamath County built in spots similarly significant to wildlife have reduced their numbers. Hubbard’s property includes some of the wetlands encompassed by the proposed site, which are important to sandhill cranes and western pond turtles.\n",
      "It’s unclear at this point the impact the facility would have on them, but a biological assessment completed this summer and included with the NOI acknowledged those habitats and the wildlife that depend on them. However, Hubbard said it didn’t take into account the importance of those ecosystems during fall and spring migration because of the time of year it was completed.\n",
      "“It looks to me, as far as I could tell, that they just came in for a week in June and a week in July, and that doesn’t give you the big picture,” Hubbard said.\n",
      "Turner said it’s likely that the EFSC process will require further biological evaluation of the site.\n",
      "Solar power requires water\n",
      "Thomas said she’s concerned that, beyond impacting local wildlife, the facility could put the area at a greater risk of fire damage, depending on the type of batteries used for energy storage. With scarce firefighting resources in Bonanza, she said that could spell serious problems for its residents.\n",
      "There’s also the question of water: the proposed site includes a well that’s connected to the Langell Valley aquifer—the same one Bonanza residents use for their own domestic wells. The solar facility would use up to 11.5 million gallons for dust control and concrete production during construction and up to 1.65 million gallons to wash the panels annually.\n",
      "It’s unclear whether all or any of that will come from the onsite well, but residents said their water supply would be negatively affected if it does.\n",
      "Residents also said there are better places to put a solar array than on productive farmland. Tonya Pinckney, who lives near Hubbard and Thomas, said there are public lands further to the west near the proposed transmission line that would be more suitable for the project.\n",
      "“A facility of this size does not belong on ag land,” Hubbard said. “There’s so many other options besides taking it out of rural America’s agriculture.”\n",
      "Lengthy approval process\n",
      "Hecate representatives couldn’t provide more specifics to address resident concerns beyond what was stated in the NOI, but they said the permitting process would allow both the company and local stakeholders to evaluate them in the future.\n",
      "“The process is very complicated, long and intensive for a reason. There are lots of opportunities along the way for community input,” Chris Edmonds, spokesman for the Bonanza Energy Facility. “We’re committed to minimizing any impacts with this project and incorporating that stakeholder feedback along the way.”\n",
      "Currently, interested parties have until November 30 to submit public comments on the NOI. After that, the Oregon Department of Energy will issue a Project Order to list the laws and ordinances the project will have to comply with. Hecate will then submit an official Application for a Site Certificate, which will incorporate how it intends to comply with those rules.\n",
      "ODOE will hold a public information meeting following that submission to explain it to the public. Then the agency will issue a Draft Proposed Order, in which it evaluates the application.\n",
      "A public hearing on the draft order (likely to occur in 2021) will allow members of the public to voice their concerns or questions about the project and ODOE’s evaluation of it.\n",
      "That’s the last chance local residents have to bring up anything new to regulators. After that, the agency will review the draft Proposed Order and issue the next version.\n",
      "Commentors who raised relevant issues at the public hearing will then participate in a contested case hearing, which ODOE will incorporate into the Final Order either approving or denying the Site Certificate Application.\n",
      "Multiple Bonanza residents have testified at the last few Klamath County Commissioner meetings, urging county leaders to voice opposition to the project during EFSC proceedings. At an October 27 meeting, Commissioner Donnie Boyd responded to those public comments in agreement.\n",
      "“I’m adamantly opposed to removing agricultural ground across the Basin,” he said. “I’m getting sick and tired of the state dictating to Klamath County and making us their asshole. We have stopped solar projects in the past. I don’t know if we can, but I’m wholly committed to helping you.”\n",

      "Dec 27, 2023 — The investigation was requisitioned through Klamath County Counsel's Office in order to advise the Klamath County Board of County.\n",
      "December 27, 2023\n",
      "BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS PRESS RELEASE\n",
      "For Immediate Release:\n",
      "Over the past several months, Klamath County has received several public records requests for an investigation conducted by Carroll Consulting, LLC, an independent third-party investigator. The investigation was requisitioned through Klamath County Counsel’s Office in order to advise the Klamath County Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) of their legal standing in relation to BOCC Resolution 2018-016. Resolution 2018-16, signed by BOCC members on February 6th, 2018, resolved that Sheriff Chris Kaber had proposed a management plan of his sons, so as to address the possible appearance of conflict of interest in their management. Sheriff Kaber’s subsequent actions had caused the BOCC concerns that the resolution was not being followed. Specifically, in June 2023, Sheriff Kaber unilaterally assigned his son, Sgt. Ryan Kaber, to the position of Sergeant Detective. Klamath County Human Resources Policy 409 requires that when, “it is determined that a violation of ORS Chapter 244 may be occurring or may have occurred, the Human Resources Director or their designee shall notify the Oregon Government Ethics Commission of the potential violation.” As required, Klamath County submitted a complaint to the Oregon Government Ethics commission on June 20, 2023. The BOCC sought this investigation to determine if there were violations of the resolution as well. Unfortunately, the investigation not only found violations of the resolution had occurred, it turned up other conflict of interest (favoritism) issues within the Sheriff’s Office. Thus, in order to protect all Klamath County personnel, the BOCC rescinded Resolution 2018-16, on September 27, 2023.\n",
      "Previously, requests for this report have been denied, as the investigation narrative met an exception to Oregon Public Records Law. The BOCC had declined to waive the attorney-client privilege of confidentiality which had excepted the document from public disclosure. The report names current county employees, and the BOCC feared its release to the public may expose those employees to retaliation. Recently, employees named in the document requested its un-redacted release. Attached hereto is the full, un-redacted version of the Carroll Consulting, LLC investigation report dated September 22, 2023.\n",
      "As there have been numerous whistleblower complaints from multiple sources, the BOCC, on behalf of Klamath County, is obligated to perform independent and objective investigations.\n",

      "Completed in 1925, Copco No. 2 was a diversion dam that funneled the river's flows out of Ward's Canyon and into a tunnel system that sent the water to the Copco No. 2 powerhouse located downstream, essentially dewatering the 1.7-mile-long canyon. This removal allows flows to enter into historic Ward's Canyon for the first time in 98 years. Photos by Shane Anderson, Swiftwater Films\n",
      "For nearly 100 years, dams on the Klamath River have blocked salmon and steelhead trout from reaching more than 400 miles of habitat, encroached on indigenous culture, and harmed water quality for people and wildlife. The time has finally come for the four dams – J.C. Boyle, Copco No. 1, Copco No. 2, and Iron Gate – built between 1908 and 1962, to come down. This river restoration project will have lasting benefits for the river, salmon, and communities throughout the Klamath Basin.

      "Four dams along the Klamath River, which runs from Oregon into northwestern California, are scheduled to be removed in 2023 and 2024 – Copco No. 1, Copco No. 2, Iron Gate, and JC Boyle. These dams total 400 vertical feet and choke fish passage along hundreds of miles of waterways, making this a historic opportunity and one of the largest dam removal projects to date. And construction has started! American Rivers is working in partnership with Tribal Nations, NGOs, the state and federal government, and local communities to ensure the health of the Klamath Rivers and the people who depend on its vitality.\n",
      "Tribal advocacy created this opportunity\n",
      "Tribal nations whose ancestral lands and histories have intersected with the Klamath watershed since time immemorial – including the Hoopa, Karuk, Yurok, Shasta, Klamath and Modoc people – have spearheaded the collective effort to remove the Klamath dams. The health of the Klamath is a key facet of these peoples’ history, culture, and subsistence, and tribal leadership and perspective has profoundly shaped the course of events on the Klamath over the past two decades. Tribally led advocacy included a high-profile protest when Berkshire Hathaway and PacifiCorp executives visited the Klamath in 2020. River advocates, led by the tribal nations, pushed the executives to join the effort to remove the Klamath dams.\n",
      "Guardians of the River\n",
      "In this film by American Rivers and Swiftwater Films, Indigenous leaders share why removing four dams to restore a healthy Klamath River is critical for clean water, food sovereignty and justice.\n",
      "Watch Now\n",
      "Many years, many players, many obstacles\n",
      "Dam removal is far from a linear process, and the journey to get to the key milestone of removal began decades ago. Though Tribes had been advocating for dam removal prior to a series of legal conflicts amongst rightsholders in the Klamath basin in 2001, a catastrophic fish kill in 2002 catalyzed wider action for dam removal. Following the fish kill, which resulted in the death of nearly 70,000 adult salmon, Tribes, NGOs, agencies, the States of California and Oregon, and individual rightsholders began working together collaboratively to address the health of the Klamath River and its communities and the movement towards dam removal began to gain momentum. Discussions around a far-ranging restoration plan in the Klamath basin began in 2005, with a proposed plan introduced to Congress in 2010. This initial legislation, the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA), failed to pass through Congress. After the KBRA failed, several parties to that agreement worked to find a solution to dam removal, ultimately known as the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA). The signatories to the KHSA, which include several NGOs, Tribes and the States of California and Oregon, created this plan as way to get dam removal done without having to seek Congress’ approval. Under the KHSA, the states and PacifiCorp take on the liability for and cost of the dams’ deconstruction, avoiding Congress entirely. This Agreement was signed in 2016, setting this new path in motion and creating the Klamath River Renewal Corporation, the entity tasked with removing the dams.\n",

      "Creating ecological resilience\n",
      "Removing the Klamath dams promises a wide range of ecosystem benefits that enhance regional climate resilience and aid the imperiled salmonid populations that once surged into the watershed from the ocean (now only 5% of historic averages). Significantly, dam removal expands spawning habitat for fish. Damming on the Klamath has also contributed to warmed water temperatures, leading to toxic algae blooms and decreased dissolved oxygen in the river. By removing the four dams, we can help bring salmonid populations back from the brink, while restoring habitat for other species. Restoration doesn’t end with the removal of the dams: additional restoration on Klamath River tributaries is needed to enhance fisheries, as well as the other flora and fauna that depend on healthy rivers to thrive. Land that was formerly inundated in reservoirs will be revegetated with native plant species following dam removal through natural seed dispersal, assisted by a program to plant millions of native and culturally significant starts and trees, providing ecologically vital riparian habitat.\n",
      "Strengthening communities through dam removal\n",
      "As salmon in the Klamath River have declined, commercial and recreational fishing have had to periodically close, impacting tourism, fishing, and other economic drivers. Dam removal along the Klamath will create newfound recreation opportunities for local communities, while also helping provide and sustain the comprehensive impacts healthy rivers have on communities, including subsistence. PacifiCorp also determined that dam removal was the best economic decision for ratepayers in the region.\n",
      "Key Dates to Know\n",
      "June 2023 – The removal of Copco No. 2, the smallest of the dams, begins.\n",
      "September 2023 – Full removal of Copco No. 2 and its related infrastructure is expected to be completed.\n",
      "January 2024 – Reservoir draw down begins for Iron Gate, Copco 1, and JC Boyle and will continue through the spring. Once drawdown is completed, dam removal and lakebed restoration activities will begin.\n",

The swamp there was dammed up into a lake and then diverted over to fish lake and down into the rogue river drainage as a water supply for the greater Medford area. This is clear cold klamath basin water that isn’t allowed to flow into the lake at all but instead sent down the west slope of the cascades. This should be a crime !! Every extra shot of cold water is necessary to restore the system. The Klamath is an extremely unique river in its “upside down “ nature .\n",

Along with the beforementioned fourmile lake, there is the diversion of jenny creek and keene creek to emigrant reservoir, and half the water from trinity river diverted to the sacramento river. All of these were good cold water that historically flowed into the Klamath River. Returning these to their natural drainage would all help with water quality. The other big piece that I don’t hear anything about is the loss of power generation from removing the Dams, and the environmental impact. These Dams averaged 536,199 Megawatthours of electricity each year. Replacing this Hydro power with power from the grid will add 255,498 TONS of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year……. 700 TONS per day!!

In my opinion the HS rail is a giant money pit trying to compete with other countries who also have it. Who’s going to ride the outfit to pay for it? Who will be able to afford it because it won’t be cheap. Unless it was never meant to be profitable in the first place and subsidized by the govt. Basically the taxpayer will have to suck it up and more than half paying for it will never step foot on it. I also don’t understand that in a time of drought, high fuel prices , over inflation , etc etc the storage of water is what we need more of , not less fir some Dad burn fish. We are at the top of the food chain. But hey I guess we won’t be able to bitch about water being sold to Southern Cali or drained to the ocean. Therewith be any to do that. In these days and times and the bs coming down on us in this country, all I’d like to say to people reading this is, you’d better get something to eat!! Or learn to grow it, raise it , harvest it, slaughter it, because famine is coming to America. Bill Gates , China and the Biden administration is trying real hard to make it real hard to feed ourselves and families. There’s going to come a time when a loaf of bread will cost you a day’s wages.

With the gas turbines Idaho power has had to install, that cost is 65 cents a kilowatt hour. Idaho power sells power on a tiered rate. The more you use the higher it gets. It averages out to about 11-12 cents a kilowatt hour for residential. The less hydros there are, the higher the price.  The reservoirs from behind these dams creates  alot of hours of recreation of all types. We still have Salmon and Steehead coming to the interior of Idaho, Up the Columbia River to the Snake and Salmon river. There is also lots of privately owned wind and solar that are expensive to build that the P.U.C. require Idaho power to buy. Life expectancy is about 20 years with these. We have hydros over 100 years old and still generating. Hydro is the cheapest and one of the cleanest forms of power.\n",

Some spanning 175 yards by 40 feet high of which my uncle and father use to land on by helicopter to deliver supplies to some of the Native Americans living up there. Without the damns the cold water needed for the fish population will be gone completely repeating exactly what they did with the Folsom aqueduct selling the cold water to LA. Our once 800,000 Chinook Salmon and steelhead runs are now lucky if we get 70,000 up the American River Chanel.  The liberal environmentalist are using a narrative without seeing the big picture.  Once the water temps go above 43 degrees our fish populations are going to drop where ick a fungus sets in and causes what we call a fish kill. So jump on this band wagon and ruin our fisheries for the future of our children.\n",

Therefore, the only practical way to reduce the amount of water removed from the River and restore flows is to reduce irrigation water demand.  That can and should be done by purchasing and retiring irrigation water rights from willing sellers in the Upper Klamath River Basin, as well as the Shasta and Scott Sub-Basins. \n",

      "CITY OF KLAMATH FALLS 226 S. 5th Street - P.O. BOX 237 KLAMATH FALLS, OREGON 97601 Sister City - Rotorua, New Zealand FAX (541) 883-5399 - TDD (541) 883-5324\n",
      "January 28, 2022\n",
      "To the Honorable Mayor, City Council, and Citizens of Klamath Falls:\n",
      "We are pleased to submit the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report for the City of Klamath Falls for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. State law requires that every general purpose local government publish, within six months of the close of each fiscal year, a complete set of audited financial statements.\n",
      "Management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of the information contained in this report, based upon a comprehensive framework of internal controls it has established for this purpose. Because the cost of internal controls should not exceed anticipated benefits, the objective is to provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance that the financial statements are free of any material misstatements.\n",
      "KDP, LLP, a firm of licensed certified public accountants, has issued an unmodified (clean) opinion on the City’s financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021. The independent auditor’s report is located at the front of the financial section of this report.\n",
      "Management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) immediately follows the independent auditor’s report and provides a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis of the basic financial statements. MD&A complements this letter of transmittal and should be read in conjunction with it.\n",
      "Profile of the government\n",
      "The City of Klamath Falls, incorporated in 1905, is located in the south central portion of Oregon, approximately 275 miles southeast of Portland and 300 miles north of Sacramento, California. The City of Klamath Falls has a land area of about 20.7 square miles and an approximate population of 22,000. Although the population within City limits is only 22,000, the entire urban growth boundary consists of approximately 42,000 people.\n",
      "The City of Klamath Falls operates under a council-manager form of government. Policy-making and legislative authorities are vested in the City Council, which consists of a mayor and a five-member council. The City Council is responsible, among other things, for passing ordinances, adopting resolutions, adopting the budget, appointing committees, and appointing the City Manager, City Attorney, and Municipal Judge. The City Manager is responsible for carrying out the policies and ordinances of the governing council, appointing City department heads and staff, and overseeing the day-to-day operations of the municipal government.\n",
      "The City Council is elected on a non-partisan basis. The Mayor and Council members are elected to four-year staggered terms, with three members elected every two years. All five council members are elected within their respective areas or wards. The mayor is elected at-large.\n",
      "The City of Klamath Falls has a permanent tax rate of $5.4423 per $1,000 of assessed valuation. Property values increased at a 3% per year level until the recession when they declined and are now beginning to recover. This revised value is called the “real value”. Taxes are assessed on the real value. The City is subject to compression, which limits the combined total of all taxes assessed on a property to $10 per $1,000, as established by Ballot Measure 5, which was passed in 1990. The rate received in fiscal year 2021 was approximately $5.225 per $1,000 of assessed value. The City of Klamath Falls collected about $403,245 more in property taxes than the prior year, including delinquent taxes, which represents approximately a 5% increase during the 2021 fiscal year.\n",
      "The City provides a full range of services, including police protection, code enforcement, municipal court, airport, the construction and maintenance of streets and other infrastructure; as well as a pool and parks facilities. Wastewater, water, geothermal, and street lighting services are also provided by the City of Klamath Falls on a fee- for-services basis.\n",
      "The City is also financially responsible for a legally separate Urban Renewal Agency that includes three urban renewal areas: Lakefront, Town Center, and Spring Street. The agency functions, in essence, as a department of the City and therefore, is included in the financial statements of the City, in addition to being reported separately.\n",
      "The Council is required to adopt a budget for two fiscal years no later than June 30 of every odd year preceding the fiscal year beginning July 1. This biennial budget serves as the foundation for the City’s financial planning and control. The budget is adopted by fund and department/division, or category (e.g., debt service or transfers out).\n",
      "Local economy\n",
      "Although economic growth for the City of Klamath Falls is beginning to slowly recover, it has not recovered as quickly as other cities in the nation. The base economic elements of the City of Klamath Falls are agriculture, transportation, tourism, manufacturing, wood products, medical, military, and other services. The progressive nature of planned economic development within the City reflects a continued effort to diversify these elements.\n",
      "Due to the City’s location in a region with a limited economic base, the unemployment rate has traditionally exceeded that of the state and the nation. The rate was 6.7 percent in 2007, jumped to 13.4 percent in 2010 during the Great Recession, then continued to decline until it hit a new high of 15.6% in April 2020 due to COVID-19. As of June 30, 2021, our unemployment rate was approximately 7.2% percent, which is 1.3% percent higher than the national average.\n",
      "The Klamath Basin prides itself on its use of alternative energy sources. With the sun shining a majority of the year, there are several solar facilities in the Basin. Additionally, our geothermal heating system has been highlighted as one of the most impressive in the country. The sidewalks downtown have a geothermal snowmelt system installed and many of the downtown buildings are heated by geothermal energy.\n",
      "The Klamath Falls area continues to work hard to attract high-tech industries. Any success in this area is also directly tied to the presence of Oregon Institute of Technology (OIT), located within the City of Klamath Falls. OIT offers computer science and engineering degrees and graduates are consistently recruited for positions around the country. Numerous technology companies compete to hire OIT graduates.\n",
      "With access to fiber optic cable, a major highway system, technical college, numerous recreational opportunities, and a good quality of life, Klamath Falls is an attractive place to live.\n",
      "The City and County, along with other stakeholders in the community, continue to work diligently to attract new commercial and industrial businesses to Klamath Falls. We look forward to a Klamath Falls that continues to grow a stronger and more diverse economy.\n",
      "Long-term financial planning and major initiatives\n",
      "The City of Klamath Falls, guided by the City Manager, looks at a ten-year sustainability model for the City. The initial model in 2014, determined that the City could not operate at status quo without resulting fund deficits ten years out. Consequently, the City was reorganized to save money and redirect resources to priority services. The City continues to balance service demands with available resources. Personnel services continue to increase in dollars spent due to the pressure of Public Employment Retirement System (PERS) funding and health care costs.\n",
      "Council’s Goals and Objectives include citizen safety, customer service, economic viability, integrity of infrastructure to ensure the City can meet long-term stability, and efficiency in delivery of services. It is up to staff to ensure the goals and objectives are met. The City recently completed a strategic plan to identify short and long- term goals. In order to meet the goal of customer service and service efficiency, the City continues to leverage opportunities with technology. The City recently completed improvements to municipal court services, by providing citizens with the opportunity to make online payments, access account information, and provide enhanced communication. During the pandemic, municipal court started offering telecourt services, which has been very successful. The City also continues to evaluate the use of citizen access portals in other divisions as a way to improve the manner in which a majority of transactions are conducted by citizens with the City. The City is in the process of implementing a 311 program which will allow citizens to report and interact with the City and Council through an app.\n",
      "During fiscal year 2021, the Airport completed the reconstruction of Taxiway D and the rehabilitation of Taxiway B1 with a majority of funding, $4.2 million, coming from discretionary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants. Design work has begun on the next FAA funded construction project which will reconstruct the airport’s secondary runway – Runway 7/25, that will be renumbered during the project to Runway 8/26. The secondary runway reconstruction project is estimated to cost over $11 million, mostly funded by the FAA. The Oregon Air Guard’s 173rd Fighter Wing, located on the airport, continues its transition to the new F-15Ex which will allow them to continue their training mission into the future.\n",
      "The Lakefront Urban Renewal District has a development agreement with Timbermill Shores who laid the infrastructure for development of several commercial lots with plans to later construct several residential condominiums. In 2013, Council approved a $900,000 payment to the developer by taking out a 10 year tax increment loan with the Escrow Reserve Fund.The City owes the developer an additional $2.48 million for work done in prior years. A Fairfield Inn and People’s Bank have recently been completed in the district and Department of Human Services building is under construction. Based on tax estimates, the City should be able to pay off the $900,000 loan and take out an additional loan to pay the developer off by the end of fiscal year 2023.\n",
      "During 2016, the Town Center Urban Renewal District reached a development agreement with Argo Klamath Two, LLC. The District gave the developer $300,000, that was borrowed from Washington Federal and will be paid back with property tax increments. Bealls, Sportsman’s Warehouse, Sherm’s Thunderbird, and Michael’s have been in operation in the District, in addition to several smaller businesses that have also been added. Bealls announced in fall of 2019 it was to be replaced by Gordman’s, a sister company. However, due to a corporate bankruptcy exacerbated by Covid 19 this store is permanently closing.\n",
      "The City formed the Spring Street Urban Renewal area in October 2017. The area has long suffered from a lack of investment in both the public and private side. A Disposition and Development Agreement was entered into in December of 2019. The vision is for a mixed-use urban for residential and commercial development. Construction began with the demolition of the existing building in April of 2020.\n",
      "The City’s Parks Division takes pride in maintaining and improving our approximately 600 acres of parks, keeping them safe, well-groomed and beautiful. Since Klamath Falls has long winters, the Division also stays busy during the winter with plowing snow from City parking lots and sidewalks, and with performing park tree maintenance.\n",
      "Additionally, the City receives grant funding for Parks projects, including the Lake Ewauna Trail Project. Major development has occurred at the Kit Carson Park, with the installation of a new off-leash dog area and landscape improvements. Development of trails within the Park is on-going. In partnership with Sky Lakes Medical Center and other partners, Klamath Commons has been completed in the downtown core. Klamath Commons provides additional natural open space and trees for citizens to enjoy throughout the year. The City Parks Division is also responsible for the Ella Redkey Pool. This outdoor swimming pool is geothermally heated and open to the public year-round. The pool offers a variety of aquatic programming for children and adults, open swim and private pool rentals.\n",
      "The City is continuing a major overhaul to the Wastewater Treatment Plant to replace facilities and equipment that are in excess of 50 years old. The nature of this work is complex in that there are several options for constructing the improvements and the existing plant must remain operational while construction moves forward. The City is utilizing an alternative delivery process known as progressive design build. Construction is underway for the front end of the plant which includes the influent pump station and headworks. The City also received our National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and one of the difficult requirements to meet is temperature. As a result, the City is evaluating getting out of the river and sending water to an irrigation district. Once the City decides is if this is feasible or not, we will continue with the remaining design and construction. We estimate concluding the project late in 2023.\n",
      "Awards and Acknowledgements\n",
      "The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the City of Klamath Falls for its Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This was the twenty-sixth year that the City has achieved this prestigious award. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a government must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized annual comprehensive financial report. This report must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements.\n",
      "A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only. We believe that our current ACFR continues to meet the Certificate of Achievement Program’s requirements, and we are submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.\n",
      "The preparation of this report would not have been possible without the skill, effort and dedication of the entire staff of the Finance Division. We wish to thank all government departments for their assistance in providing the data necessary to prepare this report. Credit is also due to the Mayor and City Council for establishing policies in a fiscally responsible and progressive manner and to the City Manager for his leadership in developing strategies to achieve those goals.\n",

      "Honorable Mayor and City Council City of Klamath Falls, Oregon\n",
      "Report on the Financial Statements\n",
      "We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City of Klamath Falls, Oregon (the City), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.\n",
      "Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n",
      "The City’s management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n",
      "Auditor’s Responsibility\n",
      "Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n",
      "An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n",
      "We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.\n",
      "Opinions\n",
      "In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City of Klamath Falls, Oregon, as of June 30, 2021, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n",
      "Other Matters\n",
      "Required Supplementary Information\n",
      "Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the required information, such as management’s discussion and analysis, certain other supplementary postemployment benefit schedules, certain pension schedules, and the general fund and major special revenue governmental fund budgetary comparison schedules as listed in the table of contents be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to management’s discussion and analysis, certain other postemployment schedules, and certain pension schedules as listed in the table of contents in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.\n",
      "The general fund and major special revenue governmental fund budgetary comparison schedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the general fund and major special revenue governmental fund budgetary comparison schedules are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.\n",
      "Other Supplementary Information\n",
      "Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements. The introductory section, other supplementary information, and statistical section listed in the table of contents are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic financial statements. The schedule of compliance with the rate covenants of the wastewater revenue refunding bonds, series 2015 is also presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.\n",
      "The other supplementary information, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards, and the schedule of compliance with the rate covenants of the wastewater revenue refunding bonds, series 2015 are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the other supplementary information as listed in the table of contents, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards, and the schedule of compliance with the rate covenants of the wastewater revenue refunding bonds, series 2015 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.\n",
      "The introductory section and statistical section have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.\n",
      "Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards\n",
      "In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 28. 2022, on our consideration of the City’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the City’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance\n",
      "Other Reporting Required by the State of Oregon\n",
      "In accordance with Oregon State Regulations, we have also issued our report dated January 28, 2022, on our consideration of the City’s compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters, including the provisions of Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) as specified in Oregon Administrative Rules 162-00-0000 through 162-10-0320 of the Minimum Standards for Audits of Oregon Municipal Corporations.

      "As management of the City of Klamath Falls (City), we offer readers of the City’s financial statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the City for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in our letter of transmittal, which can be found in the introductory section of this report.\n",
      "Financial Highlights\n",
      "The assets and deferred outflows of resources of the City exceeded its liabilities and deferred inflows of resources at the close of the most recent fiscal year by $213,580,668 (net position). Of this amount, $41,759,852 represents unrestricted net position, which may be used to meet the government’s ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors.\n",
      "The City’s total net position increased by $4,060,393.  At the close of the current fiscal year, the City’s governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $43,772,331, an increase of $3,629,445 in comparison with the prior year. Approximately 32% of this amount, $14,100,686, is available for spending at the government’s discretion (unassigned fund balance).\n",
      "At the end of the current fiscal year, unassigned fund balance for the General Fund was $15,546,193, or approximately 91% of total General Fund expenditures.\n",
      "The City’s total outstanding long-term debt increased by $5,178,891 during the current fiscal year.\n",
      "Overview of the Financial Statements\n",
      "The discussion and analysis provided here are intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s basic financial statements. The City’s basic financial statements consist of three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) the notes to the financial statements. This report also includes supplementary information intended to furnish additional detail to support the basic financial statements themselves.\n",
      "Government-wide Financial Statements. The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the City’s finances, in a manner similar to a private- sector business.\n",
      "The statement of net position presents information on all of the City’s assets and liabilities, and deferred inflows/outflows of resources, with the difference reported as net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the City is improving or deteriorating.\n",
      "The statement of activities presents information showing how the City’s net position changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused compensated absences).\n",
      "Both of the government-wide financial statements distinguish functions of the City that are principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues (governmental activities) from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user fees and charges (business-type activities). The governmental activities of the City include general government, airport, culture and recreation, public safety, and highways and streets. The business- type activities of the City include wastewater, water, and geothermal operations.\n",
      "The government-wide financial statements include not only the City itself (known as the primary government), but also three legally separate districts for which the City is financially accountable. The Klamath Falls Urban Renewal Agency, although legally separate, functions for all practical purposes as a department of the City, and therefore has been included as an integral part of the primary government.\n",
      "The government-wide financial statements can be found on the pages immediately following this Management’s Discussion and Analysis in the Basic Financial Statements of the Financial Section.\n",
      "Fund Financial Statements. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The City, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. All of the funds of the City can be divided into three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds.\n",
      "Governmental Funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on near- term inflows and outflows of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in assessing a government’s near-term financing requirements.\n",
      "Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities.\n",
      "The City maintains nine individual governmental funds (plus three funds for the Klamath Falls Urban Renewal Agency). Information is presented separately in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances for the General Fund, Airport Fund, Escrow Reserve Fund, and Capital Projects Fund, which are considered to be major funds. The Airport Fund accounts for the operation of the Crater Lake-Klamath Regional Airport and receives property taxes, rental revenue, landing fees, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants. The Escrow Reserve Fund is a major capital project fund whose primary source of revenue is proceeds from the sale of the Cogeneration Plant. Expenditures include projects outside the scope of normal business approved by City Council. Data from the other governmental funds are combined into a single aggregated presentation. Individual fund data for each of these nonmajor governmental funds is provided in the form of combining statements in the combining and individual fund statements and schedules section of this report.\n",
      "The City adopts a biennial appropriated budget for all of its funds. A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for the General Fund and Airport Fund in the required supplementary information. All other budgetary comparisons have been included in the other supplementary information to demonstrate compliance with this budget.\n",
      "The basic governmental fund financial statements follow the government-wide financial statements in the financial section of this report.\n",
      "Proprietary Funds. The City maintains one type of proprietary fund. Enterprise funds are used to report the same functions presented as business-type activities in the government-wide financial statements. The City uses enterprise funds to account for its wastewater, water and geothermal operations.\n",
      "Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the government-wide financial statements, only in more detail. The proprietary fund financial statements provide separate information for the wastewater and Water Funds, both of which are considered to be major funds of the City.\n",
      "The basic proprietary fund financial statements follow the governmental fund statements in the financial section’s basic financial statements.\n",
      "Fiduciary Funds. Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside of the government. Fiduciary funds are not reported in the government-wide financial statements because the resources of those funds are not available to support the City’s own programs. The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds.\n",
      "The City maintains one type of fiduciary fund. The Agency fund reports resources held by the City in a custodial capacity for individuals, private organizations, and other governments.\n",
      "The fiduciary fund financial statements follow the proprietary fund statements.\n",
      "Notes to Financial Statements. The notes provide additional information that is necessary to acquire a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found at the end of the financial section’s basic financial statements.\n",
      "Other Information. In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report also presents required supplementary information concerning the City’s budgetary comparisons for the General Fund and Airport Fund and Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) and pension schedules. Required supplementary information statements can be found in the financial section following the notes to the financial statements.\n",
      "The combining statements referred to earlier in connection with nonmajor governmental funds are presented immediately following the required supplementary information fund budgetary comparisons and information on OPEB and pensions. Combining and individual fund statements and schedules can be found in the financial section’s other supplementary information.\n",
      "Other Supplementary Schedules. Other schedules contain pertinent information that round out the financial section of this report.\n",
      "Government-wide Overall Financial Analysis\n",
      "As noted earlier, net position over time, may serve as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position. In the case of the City, assets exceeded liabilities by $213,580,668, at the close of the most recent fiscal year.\n",

      "By far, the largest portion of the City’s net position (77.2%) reflects its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, construction in progress, intangible assets, buildings and system, machinery and equipment, and infrastructure), less any related outstanding debt that was used to acquire those assets. The City uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens. Accordingly, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the City’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources used to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.\n",
      "An additional portion of the City’s net position (3.3%) represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. The remaining balance of $41,759,852 is unrestricted and may be used to meet the government’s ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors.\n",
      "At the end of the current fiscal year, the City reported positive balances in all categories of net position, both for the government as a whole, as well as for its separate governmental and business- type activities. The same held true for the prior fiscal year.\n",
      "City of Klamath Falls’ Net Position June 30, 2020 and 2021\n",
      "The City’s overall net position increased $4,060,393 from the prior fiscal year. The reasons for this overall increase are discussed in the following sections for governmental activities and business-type activities.\n",
      "Governmental Activities. During the current fiscal year, net position for governmental activities increased by $768,471. As net position increased for governmental activities, governmental expenses have decreased $586,082 from the prior year mainly due to a decrease in capital expenditures. Program revenues decreased $2,675,400 due to a decrease in grant revenue for the Airport. General revenues decreased by $221,772 due to a decrease in investment income. The City’s main source of revenue for governmental activities, property taxes, increased $403,245 which is a 4.7 percent increase over the prior fiscal year. $60,924 of this increase came from surplus property sales. The City uses a ten-year forecasting model which helps to ensure a positive net position.\n",
      "Expenses and Program Revenues - Governmental Activities\n",
      "Business-type Activities. For the City’s business-type activities, the results for the current fiscal year show an increase in the overall net position. The net position increased to an ending balance of $81,047,762. The total increase in net position for business-type activities (Wastewater and Water Funds) was $3,291,922 or 4.2% from the prior fiscal year. The primary reason for the increase was an increase in operating revenues. Current and other assets increased $1,090,275. Each year, there is a rate increase in water and wastewater in accordance with a designated consumer price index (CPI). This allows a predictable $1.5 million increase to net position annually. In addition, rates were raised several years ago in the Wastewater Fund in anticipation of building a treatment plant and complying with environmental regulations. Construction began in fiscal year 2019 and is estimated to be completed in 2023. There will still likely be offsite improvements to construct related to disposal of the treated effluent. Efforts to quantify what those improvements are, determine cost, and eventually construct are currently underway. Water rates were also designed to keep up with capital maintenance and allow for an increase of approximately $2.2 - $2.5 million annually.\n",

      "As noted earlier, the City uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance- related legal requirements.\n",
      "Governmental Funds. The focus of the City’s governmental funds is to provide information on the near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the City’s financing requirements. In particular, unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for discretionary use as they represent the portion of fund balance which has not yet been limited to use for a particular purpose by either an external party, the City itself, or a group or individual that has been delegated authority to assign resources for particular purposes by the City’s Council.\n",
      "At June 30, 2021, the City’s governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $43,772,331 an increase of $3,629,445 in comparison with the prior year. Approximately 32% of this amount, $14,100,686, constitutes unassigned fund balance, which is available for spending at the government’s discretion. The remainder of the fund balance is either nonspendable, restricted, or assigned to indicate that it is 1) not in spendable form ($50,637), 2) legally required to be maintained intact or restricted for particular purposes ($5,453,376), or 3) assigned for particular purposes ($24,167,632).\n",

At the end of the current fiscal year, unassigned fund balance of the General Fund was $15,546,193, while total fund balance increased to $16,608,398. As a measure of the General Fund’s liquidity, it may be useful to compare both unassigned fund balance and total fund balance to total General Fund expenditures. Unassigned fund balance represents approximately 90.5% of total General Fund expenditures, while total fund balance represents approximately 96.7% of that same amount. The City’s fund balance policies are in the notes to the financial statements.\n",
      "The fund balance of the City’s General Fund increased by $1,912,065 during the current fiscal year. Revenues increased $712,724 from the prior reporting period. Direct taxes, the General Fund’s primary revenue source, increased $486,395 which is a six percent (6%) increase. Intergovernmental revenue increased $213,281. Expenditures were $90,468 lower in the current year compared to the\n",

      "NOTE I – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n",
      "A. Description of government-wide financial statements\n",
      "The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net position and the statement of activities) report information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the primary government and its component unit. All fiduciary activities are reported only in the fund financial statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and other nonexchange transactions, are reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges to external customers for support.\n",
      "B. Reporting entity\n",
      "The City of Klamath Falls, Oregon (located in Klamath County), was incorporated in 1905. The City Council, composed of the Mayor and Council members, forms the legislative branch of the government. Administration of the government is vested in the City Manager. The accompanying financial statements present the government and its component unit, an entity for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. The blended component unit is, in substance, part of the government’s operations, even though it is a legally separate entity. Thus, the blended component unit is appropriately presented as a fund of the primary government.\n",
      "Blended component unit. The Klamath Falls Urban Renewal Agency (Agency) is composed of the Lakefront Urban Renewal Fund, the Town Center Urban Renewal Fund, and the Spring Street Urban Renewal Fund. The Agency is a legally separate entity, governed by a board comprised of the members of City Council. The City Council has the ability to impose its will on the Agency as determined on the basis of budget adoption, taxing authority, and funding for the Agency.\n",
      "Requests for the Agency’s financial statements can be obtained from the City of Klamath Falls administration office located at 500 Klamath Avenue, Klamath Falls, Oregon 97601, URL: https://www.klamathfalls.city/i- want-to/find/city-hall/support-services/finance or by telephone: (541) 883-5316.\n",
      "C. Basis of presentation – government-wide financial statements\n",
      "While separate government-wide and fund financial statements are presented, they are interrelated. The governmental activities column incorporates data from governmental funds, while business-type activities incorporate data from the government’s enterprise funds. Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the fiduciary funds are excluded from the government-wide financial statements.\n",
      "As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide financial statements. Exceptions to this general rule are payments in lieu of taxes where the amounts are reasonably equivalent in value to the interfund services provided and other charges between the government’s water and sewer functions and various other functions of the government. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the various functions concerned.\n",
      "D. Basis of presentation – fund financial statements\n",
      "The fund financial statements provide information about the government’s funds, including its fiduciary funds and blended component unit. Separate statements for each fund category – governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary – are presented. The emphasis of fund financial statements is on major governmental and enterprise funds, each displayed in a separate column. All remaining governmental and enterprise funds are aggregated and reported as nonmajor funds. Major individual governmental and enterprise funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements.\n",
      "NOTE I – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n",
      "The government reports the following major governmental funds:\n",
      "The General Fund is the government's primary operating fund. It accounts for all financial resources of the general government, except those required to be accounted for in another fund. Principal sources of revenue are property taxes, franchise fees, grants, state and county shared revenues, and administrative services from other funds. Primary expenditures are for general government, police, streets, and culture and recreation.\n",
      "The Airport Fund is a special revenue fund whose primary source of revenue is intergovernmental grants for capital construction and improvements to the airport runways and facilities. Other revenues consist of property taxes, transient room taxes, rental revenue, landing fees and passenger facility charges. Expenditures are assigned or restricted for airport operations and capital.\n",
      "The Capital Projects Fund accounts for the funds received for major projects and acquisitions. Revenues consist of lease payments for the finance/utility billing building and investment income. Capital projects may be completed and expensed within the Capital Projects Fund or funds may be transferred out to the originating fund once the projects begin.\n",
      "The Escrow Reserve Fund is a capital project fund whose primary source of revenue is proceeds from the sale of the Cogeneration Plant that have been completely paid out. Expenditures include projects outside the scope of normal business approved by City Council.\n",
      "The government reports the following major enterprise funds:\n",
      "The Wastewater Fund accounts for the expansion, operation, and maintenance of the government’s sanitary sewer system.\n",
      "The Water Fund accounts for the expansion, operation and maintenance of the government's water supply system and its geothermal heating distribution system.\n",
      "The government also reports nonmajor funds in the following categories: special revenue funds, capital projects funds, and debt service funds.\n",
      "Additionally, government reports the following custodial fund:\n",
      "The Veterans Memorial Agency Fund accounts for monies held on behalf of the Veterans Memorial Committee that uses donations to maintain the memorial at Veterans Park.\n",
      "During the course of operations, the government has activity between funds for various purposes. Any residual balances outstanding at year end are reported as due from/to other funds and advances to/from other funds. While these balances are reported in fund financial statements, certain eliminations are made in the preparation of the government-wide financial statements. Balances between the funds included in governmental activities are eliminated so that only the net amount is included as internal balances in the governmental activities column. Similarly, balances between the funds included in business-type activities are eliminated so that only the net amount is included as internal balances in the business-type activities column.\n",
      "Indirect expenses, which includes general government, support services, and administrative costs, are allocated based on a full-cost allocation approach, thereby allocating indirect expenses among functions with the objective of allocating all expenses. This allocation is done through the General Fund and is included in direct program expenses for the various functional activities within individual funds.\n",
      "NOTE I – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n",
      "Further, certain activity occurs during the year involving transfers of resources between funds. In fund financial statements, these amounts are reported at gross amounts as transfers in/out. While reported in fund financial statements, certain eliminations are made in the preparation of the government-wide financial statements. Transfers between the funds included in governmental activities are eliminated so that only the net amount is included as transfers in the governmental activities column. Similarly, balances between the funds included in business-type activities are eliminated so that only the net amount is included as transfers in the business-type activities column.\n",
      "E. Measurement focus and basis of accounting\n",
      "The accounting and financial reporting treatment is determined by the applicable measurement focus and basis of accounting. Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured such as current financial resources or economic resources. The basis of accounting indicates the timing of transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements.\n",
      "The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met.\n",
      "The governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the government considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. General capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Issuance of long- term debt and acquisition under capital leases are reported as other financing sources.\n",
      "Property taxes, franchise fees, licenses, and interest associated with the current fiscal period are all considered to be susceptible to accrual and so have been recognized as revenues of the current fiscal period. Expenditure- driven grants are recognized as revenue when the qualifying expenditures have been incurred, all other eligibility requirements have been met, and the amount is received during the period or within the availability period for this revenue source (within 60 days of year-end). All other revenue items are considered to be\n",
      "measurable and available only when cash is received by the government.\n",
      "The proprietary funds are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. The agency fund has no measurement focus but utilizes the accrual basis of accounting for reporting its assets and liabilities.\n",
      "F. Budgetary information\n",
      "1. Budgetary basis of accounting\n",
      "On or before June 30 of every other year, the government enacts a resolution adopting a biennial budget, appropriating the expenditures, and levying the property taxes. The government is required to prepare a balanced budget for each fund in accordance with ORS 294 – Local Budget Law. The government’s budget is presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting.\n",
      "The Budget Committee, which consists of the City Council and an equal number of citizens of the City, conducts public hearings for the purpose of obtaining citizens’ comments, and then approves\n",
      "NOTE I – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n",
      "a budget and submits it to the City Council for final adoption. The approved expenditures for each fund may not be increased by more than ten (10) percent by Council without returning to the Budget Committee for a second approval.\n",
      "The resolution authorizing appropriations for each fund sets the legal level of control by which expenditures cannot legally exceed appropriations. Total expenditures by division as established by the resolution are the legal level of control for the funds. Non-departmental expenditures within the funds are categorized by materials and services, capital outlay, debt service, transfers, and contingency, and are the legal level of control for non-departmental expenditures. The detail budget document, however, is required to contain more specific information for the above-mentioned expenditure categories.\n",
      "The City Council may modify the budget by transferring appropriations between levels of control and by adopting supplemental budgets. Unexpected additional resources may be added to the budget through the use of a supplemental budget. A supplemental budget requires hearings before the public, publications in newspapers, and adoption by the City Council. Original and supplemental budgets may be modified by the use of appropriation transfers between the levels of control. Such transfers require approval by the City Council. The government had appropriation transfers and supplemental budgets during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. Appropriations lapse at the end of the biennium budget period.\n",
      "2. Excess of expenditures over appropriations\n",
      "For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, there were no funds that exceeded budget at the legal level of appropriation.\n",
      "G. Assets, liabilities, deferred outflows/inflows of resources, and net position/fund balance\n",
      "1. Cash and cash equivalents\n",
      "The government's cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits, and short- term investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.\n",
      "2. Investments\n",
      "The government’s investment policy is in accordance with ORS 294 and sets the parameters within which funds are invested to ensure effective and judicious management of funds. Investments for the government are reported at fair value. The government participates in the Oregon State Treasurer’s Local Government Investment Pool (LGIP), an open-ended, no-load, diversified portfolio created under ORS 294.805 to 294.895. The LGIP is administered by the State Treasurer and the Oregon Investment Council with the advice of the Oregon Short-Term Bond Fund Board. The Oregon State Treasurer’s Office has calculated the fair value of the underlying investments of the LGIP and the government’s share of fair value is the same as the reported value. The individual funds’ and blended component unit’s portion of the pool’s fair value are presented as “Cash and Cash Equivalents” in the basic financial statements as these are demand deposits.\n",
      "3. Inventories and prepaid items\n",
      "All inventories are valued at cost using first-in/first-out (FIFO) basis and are accounted for using the consumption method.\n",
      "Within the proprietary funds, prepaid items are accounted for using the consumption method. Within the governmental funds, prepaid items are accounted for using the purchases method.\n",
      "NOTE I – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n",
      "4. Capital assets\n",
      "Capital assets include property (including right of way easements), plant, equipment (including computer software), and infrastructure assets (e.g., roads, bridges, sidewalks, and similar items), and are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. Capital assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if actual cost is not available. Donated capital assets, donated works of art, and similar items, and capital assets received in a service concession agreement are reported at acquisition value.\n",
      "Capital assets are defined by the government as assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5,000, and an initial useful life extending beyond a single reporting period. All property, right of way easements, and vehicles (rolling stock) are capitalized regardless of cost. The government reports infrastructure assets on a network and subsystem basis. Accordingly, the amounts spent for the construction or acquisition of infrastructure assets are capitalized and reported in the government-wide financial statements regardless of their amount.\n",
      "The government’s computer software, an intangible asset, is deemed to have an indefinite useful life as there are no legal, contractual, regulatory, technological, or other factors that limit the useful life. If changes in factors and conditions arise that affect the indefinite life, the carrying value of the software will be amortized in subsequent reporting periods over the estimated remaining useful life. The government capitalizes commercially purchased software that was licensed by the government and modified using more than minimal incremental effort before being put into operation. These programs include financial accounting, geographic information systems, and engineering construction programs.\n",
      "The reported value excludes normal maintenance and repairs which essentially are amounts spent in relation to capital assets that do not increase the capacity or efficiency of the item or extend its useful life beyond the original estimate.\n",
      "Land, construction in progress, and certain intangible assets are not depreciated. Property, plant, and equipment of the government are depreciated using the “straight line” method.\n",
      "The estimated useful lives of capital assets are:\n",
      "Infrastructure & land improvements – 20 to 40 years  Buildings & building improvements – 10 to 40 years  Machinery & equipment – 5 to 25 years   Vehicles – 3 to 5 years Intangible assets – 5 to 10 years\n",
      "5. Deferred outflows/inflows of resources\n",
      "In addition to assets, the statement of financial position reports a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.\n",
      "In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position reports a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.\n",
      "NOTE I – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n",
      "6. Net position flow assumption\n",
      "Sometimes the government will fund outlays for a particular purpose from both restricted (e.g., restricted bond or grant proceeds) and unrestricted resources. In order to calculate the amounts to report as restricted net position and unrestricted net position in the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements, a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the resources are considered to be applied. It is the government’s policy to consider restricted net position to have been depleted before unrestricted net position is applied.\n",
      "7. Fund balance flow assumptions\n",
      "Sometimes the government will fund outlays for a particular purpose from both restricted and unrestricted resources (the total of committed, assigned, and unassigned fund balance). In order to calculate the amounts to report as restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned fund balance in the governmental fund financial statements a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the resources are considered to be applied. It is the government’s policy to consider restricted fund balance to have been depleted before using any of the components of unrestricted fund balance. Further, when the components of unrestricted fund balance can be used for the same purpose, committed fund balance is depleted first, followed by assigned fund balance. Unassigned fund balance is applied last.\n",
      "8. Fund balance policies\n",
      "In accordance with Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions, the government classifies governmental fund balances as follows:\n",
      "Non-spendable – includes fund balance amounts that cannot be spent either because it is not in spendable form or because of legal or contractual constraints.\n",
      "Restricted – includes fund balance amounts that are constrained for specific purposes which are externally imposed by providers, such as creditors, or amounts constrained due to constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.\n",
      "Committed – includes fund balance amounts that are constrained for specific purposes that are internally imposed by the government through formal action of the highest level of decision-making authority and does not lapse at year-end. The government’s highest formal action is an ordinance approved by the City Council.\n",
      "Assigned – includes fund balance amounts that are intended to be used for specific purposes that are neither considered restricted or committed. Fund Balance may be assigned by the City Manager or his/her designee per the Financial Policies.\n",
      "Unassigned – includes positive fund balance within the General Fund which has not been classified within the above-mentioned categories and negative fund balances in other governmental funds.\n",
      "Minimum fund balance policies. The City Council annually adopts a reserve balance in the General Fund of at least 20% of the annual General Fund operating budget. If Council authorizes expenditure of reserves for any purpose identified in the previous section, which causes reserve balances to fall below 20%, reserves must begin to be restored in the fiscal year following their use.\n",
      "NOTE I – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n",
      "The City Council annually adopts a reserve balance in the Water and Wastewater Funds of at least 15% of the annual operating budget. The City Council annually adopts a reserve balance in other funds receiving property tax support at a minimum level of 10% of the annual operating budget. Other special revenue funds will be evaluated individually based on the type of service, potential for unexpected expenditures, and purpose of the fund, to determine the appropriate reserve. There may be some funds that require no reserve.\n",
      "H. Revenues and expenditures/expenses\n",
      "1. Program revenues\n",
      "Amounts reported as program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or segment and 2) grants and contributions (including special assessments) that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function or segment. All taxes, including those dedicated for specific purposes, and other internally dedicated resources are reported as general revenues rather than as program revenues.\n",
      "2. Property taxes\n",
      "Property taxes attach as an enforceable lien on real property and are levied as of July 1. Taxes are billed in October and payments are due on November 15 of the same calendar year. Under the partial payment schedule, the first one-third of taxes is due on November 15, the second one-third on February 15, and the remaining one-third on May 15. A discount of 3 percent is allowed if full payment is made by November 15; a 2 percent discount is allowed for a two-thirds payment made by November 15. Taxes unpaid and outstanding on May 16 are considered delinquent and are subject to lien, and penalties and interest are assessed.\n",
      "The government participates in a number of property tax abatement programs. All such abatement programs are authorized by Oregon revised statutes or by local resolution or ordinance. Some programs are initiated by the government and others by other local governments and state agencies. There were no material taxes abated for the year ended June 30, 2021.\n",
      "3. Compensated absences\n",
      "Vacation\n",
      "The government’s policy permits employees to accumulate up to 240 hours of earned but unused vacation benefits depending on the contract and years of service. These hours are eligible for payment upon separation from government service. The liability for such leave is reported as incurred in the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements. A liability for those amounts is recorded in the governmental funds only if the liability has matured as a result of employee resignations or retirements.\n",
      "Sick Leave\n",
      "The government’s policy permits employees to accumulate earned but unused sick leave benefits. When AFSCME and Teamsters employees, hired before July 1, 2011, leave the government’s employment, sick leave is paid at a graduated scale based on years employed, not to exceed 25% of 960 hours. AFSCME and Teamsters employees hired after July 1, 2011, no longer qualify for a sick leave payout upon leaving the government. Exempt employees may have two sick leave banks. All sick leave accumulated prior to July 1, 2011 is tracked as “frozen sick leave”. Amounts remaining on the books upon\n",
      "NOTE I – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n",
      "upon termination are paid at a graduated scale based on years employed but not to exceed 25% of 960 hours. Leave amounts accrued after July 1, 2011 are tracked as current sick leave, which is no longer subject to a payout upon termination. Instead, the government will convert up to 32 hours of accrued current sick leave to cash and contribute the balance to a Voluntary Employee’s Beneficiary Account (VEBA) on July 1st of each year for non-represented employees hired before July 1, 2015. The liability for sick leave is reported as incurred in the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements. A liability for those amounts is recorded in the governmental funds only if the liability has matured as a result of employee resignations or retirements.\n",
      "Compensatory Time Leave\n",
      "The government’s policy permits AFSCME represented employees to accumulate up to 80 hours, and Teamsters represented employees to accumulate up to 120 hours of earned but unpaid compensatory time off. Straight overtime hours worked are accumulated at the straight rate for hours worked, while overtime hours worked are accumulated at the rate of time and one-half. This accumulation is eligible for payment upon separation from government service. The government may compensate Teamsters represented employees at fiscal year-end for all accrued compensatory time in excess of 40 hours. All time over the allowed accumulation must be paid in full when earned. The liability for compensatory time is reported as incurred in the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements. A liability for those amounts is recorded in the governmental funds only if the liability has matured as a result of employee resignations or retirements.\n",
      "4. Proprietary fund operating and nonoperating revenues and expenses\n",
      "Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund's principal ongoing operations. The principal operating revenues of the Wastewater and Water Funds are charges to customers for services provided. Operating expenses for proprietary funds include the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses, and depreciation on capital assets. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.\n",
      "NOTE II – STEWARDSHIP, COMPLIANCE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n",
      "A. Revenue diversion\n",
      "The government was in compliance with the Policies and Procedures Concerning the Generation and Use of Airport Revenue, issued February 16, 1999 (64 CFR 7695), which requires that all airport revenues generated by a public airport will be expended for the capital or operating costs of the airport, the local airport system, or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport, and are directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.\n",
      "B. Violations of legal or contractual provisions\n",
      "There were no violations of legal or contractual provisions for the year ended June 30, 2021.\n",
      "C. Deficit fund equity\n",
      "At June 30, 2021, the Lakefront Urban Renewal Fund has a deficit fund balance of $560,051, the Town Center Urban Renewal Fund has a deficit fund balance of $45,032, and the Spring Street Urban Renewal Fund has a deficit fund balance of $840,424. The reason for the deficits are interfund loans. The interfund loans are reported as a fund liability on the Governmental Funds balance sheets (rather than an inflow on the statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance). This deficit will be eliminated as the scheduled principal payments on the loans are made.\n",

      "Fair Value Measurement. GASB Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application, specifies a hierarchy of valuation classifications based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used in each valuation classification are observable or unobservable. These Classifications are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:\n",
      "Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n",
      "Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are active, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities (such as exchange rates, financing terms, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risk and default rates).\n",
      "Level 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which significant inputs or significant valuation drivers are unobservable.\n",
      "NOTE III – DETAILED NOTES ON ALL ACTIVITIES AND FUNDS (continued)\n",
      "The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets of identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the fair value hierarchy classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n",
      "The categorization of a value determined for investments is based on the pricing transparency of the investments and is not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those securities.\n",
      "The government categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The government has recorded its investments at fair value, and primarily uses the Market Approach to value each security. Security pricing is provided by a third-party and reported to the government by its custodian bank. Assets are categorized by asset type, which is a key component of determining hierarchy levels. Asset types allowable per the government’s investment policy generally fall within hierarchy level 1 and 2.\n",
      "As of June 30, 2021, the government’s investments in U.S. Treasury Securities are classified as Level 1. All other securities, excluding the Local Government Investment Pool, which is valued at amortized cost and is not in the leveling hierarchy, are classified as Level 2.\n",

      "Plan description. Employees of the government are provided with pensions through the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan. The Oregon Legislature has delegated authority to the Public Employees Retirement Board to administer and manage the system. All benefits of the System are established by the legislature pursuant to ORS Chapters 238 and 238A. Tier One/Tier Two Retirement Benefit Plan, established by ORS Chapter 238, is closed to new members hired on or after August 29, 2003. The Pension Program, established by ORS Chapter 238A, provides benefits to members hired on or after August 29, 2003. OPERS issues a publicly available Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Actuarial Valuation that can be obtained at: https://www.oregon.gov/pers/EMP/Pages/Actuarial- Financial-Information.aspx.\n",

      "1. Tier One/Tier Two Retirement Benefit, ORS Chapter 238\n",
      "Pension benefits. The PERS retirement allowance is payable monthly for life. It may be selected from thirteen retirement benefit options. These options include survivorship benefits and lump-sum refunds. The basic benefit is based on years of service and final average salary. A percentage (2.0 percent for police and fire employees, 1.67 percent for general service employees) is multiplied by the number of years of service and the final average salary. Benefits may also be calculated under either a formula plus annuity (for members who were contributing before August 21, 1981) or a money match computation if a greater benefit results.\n",
      "A member is considered vested and will be eligible at minimum retirement age for a service retirement allowance if he or she has had a contribution in each of five calendar years or has reached at least 50 years of age before ceasing employment with a participating employer (age 45 for police members). General service employees may retire after reaching age 55. Police members are eligible after reaching age 50. Tier One general service employee benefits are reduced if retirement occurs prior to age 58, with fewer than 30 years of service. Police member benefits are reduced if retirement occurs prior to age 55, with fewer than 25 years of service. Tier Two members are eligible for full benefits at age 60. The ORS Chapter 238 Defined Benefit Pension Plan is closed to new members hired on or after August 29, 2003.\n",
      "Death benefits. Upon the death of a non-retired member, the beneficiary receives a lump-sum refund of the member’s account balance (accumulated contributions and interest). In addition, the beneficiary will receive a lump-sum payment from employer funds equal to the account balance, provided one or more of the following conditions are met:\n",
      "  \n",
      "the member was employed by a PERS employer at the time of death, the member died within 120 days after termination of PERS-covered employment, the member died as a result of injury sustained while employed in a PERS-covered job, or the member was on an official leave of absence from a PERS-covered job at the time of death.\n",
      "Disability benefits. A member with 10 or more years of creditable service who becomes disabled from other than duty-connected causes may receive a non-duty disability benefit. A disability resulting from a job- incurred injury or illness qualifies a member (including PERS judge members) for disability benefits regardless of the length of PERS-covered service. Upon qualifying for either a non-duty or duty disability, service time is computed to age 58 (55 for police members) when determining the monthly benefit.\n",
      "Benefit Changes After Retirement. After retirement, members may choose to continue participation in a variable equities investment account after retiring and may experience annual benefit fluctuations due to changes in the market value of equity investments. Under ORS 238.360, monthly benefits are adjusted through cost-of-living changes (COLA). The COLA is capped at 2.0%.\n",
      "2. OPSRP Defined Benefit Pension Program (OPSRP DB)\n",
      "Pension benefits. The Pension Program (ORS Chapter 238A) provides benefits to members hired on or after August 29, 2003. This portion of OPSRP provides a life pension funded by employer contributions. Benefits are calculated with the following formula for members who attain normal retirement age:\n",
      "Police: 1.8 percent is multiplied by the number of years of service and the final average salary. Normal retirement age for police members is age 60, or age 53 with 25 years of retirement credit. To be classified as a police member, the individual must have been employed continuously as a police member for at least five years immediately preceding retirement.\n",
      "General service: 1.5 percent is multiplied by the number of years of service and the final average salary. Normal retirement age for general service members is age 65, or age 58 with 30 years of retirement credit.\n",

      "Death benefits. Upon the death of a non-retired member, the spouse or other person who is constitutionally required to be treated in the same manner as the spouse, receives for life 50 percent of the pension that would otherwise have been paid to the deceased member.\n",
      "Disability benefits. A member who has accrued 10 or more years of retirement credits before the member becomes disabled, or a member who becomes disabled due to job-related injury, shall receive a disability benefit of 45 percent of the member’s salary determined as of the last full month of employment before the disability occurred.\n",
      "Benefit changes after retirement. Under ORS 238A.210, monthly benefits are adjusted annually through cost- of-living adjustments (COLA). Under current law, the cap on the COLA in fiscal year 2015 and beyond will vary based on 1.25 percent on the first $60,000 of annual benefit and $750 plus 0.15 percent on annual benefits above $60,000.\n",
      "3. OPSRP Individual Account Program (OPSRP IAP)\n",
      "Pension benefits. The Individual Account Program (IAP) is a defined contribution pension plan. The IAP is an individual account-based program under the PERS tax-qualified governmental plan as defined under ORS 238A.400. An IAP member becomes vested on the date the employee account is established or on the date the rollover account was established. If the employer makes optional employer contributions for a member, the member becomes vested on the earliest of the following dates: the date the member completes 600 hours of service in each of five calendar years, the date the member reaches normal retirement age, the date the IAP is terminated, the date the active member becomes disabled, or the date the active member dies.\n",
      "Upon retirement, a member of the OPSRP Individual Account Program (IAP) may receive the amounts in his or her employee account, rollover account, and vested employer account, as a lump-sum payment or in equal installments over a 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-year period or an anticipated life span option. Each distribution option has a $200 minimum distribution limit.\n",
      "Death benefits. Upon the death of a non-retired member, the beneficiary receives in a lump sum, the member’s account balance, rollover account balance, and vested employer optional contribution account balance. If a retired member dies before the installment payments are completed, the beneficiary may receive the remaining installment payments or choose a lump-sum payment.\n",
      "Recordkeeping. OPERS contracts with VOYA Financial to maintain IAP participant records.\n",
      "Employer Contributions. PERS funding policy provides for monthly employer contributions at actuarially determined rates. These contributions, expressed as a percentage of covered payroll, are intended to accumulate sufficient assets to pay benefits when due. This funding policy applies to the PERS Defined Benefit Plan and the Other Postemployment Benefit Plans. Employer contribution rates during the period were based on the December 31, 2015 actuarial valuation. The rates based on a percentage of payroll first became effective July 1, 2017. Employer contributions for the year ended June 30, 2021, were $1,612,330, excluding amounts to fund employer specific liabilities. The rates in effect for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, were 20.54 percent for Tier One/Tier Two members, 11.41 percent for OPSRP Pension Program General Service Members, and 16.04 percent for OPSRP Pension Program Police Members.\n",

Beginning January 1, 2004, all employee contributions were placed in the OPSRP Individual Account Program (IAP), a defined contribution pension plan established by the Oregon Legislature. Prior to that date, all member contributions were credited to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan. Member contributions are set by statute at 6.0 percent of salary and are remitted by participating employers. The contributions are either deducted from member salaries or paid by the employers on the members behalf. The IAP member accounts represent member contributions made on or after January 1, 2004, plus earnings allocations less disbursements for refunds, death benefits, and retirements.

GASB 68 generally requires that a blended discount rate be used to measure the Total Pension Liability (the Actuarial Accrued Liability calculated using the Individual Entry Age Normal Cost Method). The long-term expected return on plan investments may be used to discount liabilities to the extent that the plan’s Fiduciary Net Position is projected to cover benefit payments and administrative expenses. A 20-year high quality (AA/Aa or higher) municipal bond rate must be used for periods where the Fiduciary Net Position is not projected to cover benefit payments and administrative expenses. Determining the discount rate under GASB 68 will often require that the actuary perform complex projections of future benefit payments and pension plan investments. GASB 68 (paragraph 67) does allow for alternative evaluations of projected solvency if such evaluation can reliably be made. GASB does not contemplate a specific method for making an alternative evaluation of sufficiency; it is left to professional judgment.\n",
      "The following circumstances justify an alternative evaluation of sufficiency for PERS:\n",
      "PERS has a formal written policy to calculate an Actuarially Determined Contribution (ADC), which is articulated in the actuarial valuation report.\n",
      "The ADC is based on a closed, layered amortization period, which means that payment of the full ADC each year will bring the plan to a 100% funded position by the end of the amortization period if future experience follows assumption.\n",
      "NOTE III – DETAILED NOTES ON ALL ACTIVITIES AND FUNDS (continued)\n",
      "GASB 68 specifies that the projections regarding future solvency assume that plan assets earn the assumed rate return and there are no future changes in the plan provisions or actuarial methods and assumptions, which means that the projections would not reflect any adverse future experience which might impact the plan’s funded position.\n",

Senate Bill 822 also required the contribution rates scheduled to be in effect from July 2013 to June 2015 to be reduced. The Oregon Supreme Court decision in Moro v. State of Oregon, issued on April 30, 2015, reversed a significant portion of the reductions the 2013 Oregon Legislature made to future System Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA) through Senate Bills 822 and 861.

      "On or before June 30 of every other year, the City enacts a resolution adopting the biennial budget, appropriating the expenditures, and levying the property taxes. The City is required to prepare a budget for each fund that is balanced in accordance with ORS 294 – Local Budget Law. The City’s budget is presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting which is not the same basis as GAAP.\n",
      "The Budget Committee, which consists of the City Council and an equal number of citizens of the City, conducts public hearings for obtaining citizens’ comments, and then approves a budget and submits it to the City Council for final adoption. The approved expenditures for each fund may not be increased by more than 10 percent by Council without returning to the Budget Committee for a second approval.\n",
      "The resolution authorizing appropriations for each fund sets the legal level of control by which expenditures cannot legally exceed appropriations. Total expenditures by department as established by the resolution are the legal level of control for the funds. Non-departmental expenditures within the funds are categorized by materials and services, capital outlay, debt service, transfers and contingency and are the legal level of control for non- departmental expenditures. The detail budget document, however, contains more specific information for the above-mentioned expenditure categories.\n",
      "The City Council may modify the budget by transferring appropriations between levels of control and by adopting supplemental budgets. Unexpected additional resources may be added to the budget through the use of a supplemental budget. A supplemental budget requires hearings before the public, publications in newspapers, and adoption by the City Council. Original and supplemental budgets may be modified by the use of appropriation transfers between the levels of control. Such transfers require approval by the City Council. The City had supplemental budgets during the year-ended June 30, 2021. Appropriations lapse as of year-end.\n",

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the City’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.\n",
      "Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.\n",
      "Compliance and Other Matters\n",
      "As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the City’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.\n",
      "Purpose of this Report\n",
      "The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the City’s internal control and compliance.

      "Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program\n",
      "We have audited the City of Klamath Falls, Oregon’s (the City) compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on the City’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2021. The City’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.\n",
      "Management’s Responsibility\n",
      "Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.\n",
      "Auditor’s Responsibility\n",
      "Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the City’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the City’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\n",
      "We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the City’s compliance.\n",
      "Opinion on Each Major Federal Program\n",
      "In our opinion, the City, complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2021.\n",
      "Report on Internal Control Over Compliance\n",
      "Management of the City is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered the City’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control over compliance.\n",

      "Issue: In the matter of adopting the Solar Ordinance as part of the Klamath County Land Development Code\n",
      "Background: In 2019, the Klamath County Planning Commission concluded the Klamath County Land Development Code did not fully protect farm land or critical wildlife habitat. It was determined that an ordinance was needed to: 1. protect the County’s most productive farm land; 2. preserve established water rights; 3. protect the best winter deer range; and 4. establish application standards, criteria, and reporting which are clear and objective. Over the last 4 years, Planning Commission has worked with landowners, cities, and the solar industry and held multiple public hearings to craft the proposed Ordinance.\n",
      "On April 26\", the Planning Commission held a joint Board of County Commissioners / Planning Commission public hearing to discuss the proposed solar ordinance. Planning Commission opened the Solar Ordinance agenda item, took testimony, and deliberated. The Planning Commission then made a motion to recommend to the Board of County Commissioners adoption of the Solar Ordinance as written. This motion was unanimously approved by the Planning Commission.\n",
      "The meeting was turned over to the Board of County Commissioners who decided to leave the record closed and deliberate the Solar Ordinance on May 24\" at 8:30 am at the BOCC Business Meeting, so County Counsel had time to review the Solar Ordinance.\n",

      "Applicant: Klamath County (via Planning Dept.)\n",
      "Application: Consideration of adding a Solar Ordinance to the Land Development Code by adding Article XX (Commercial Solar Systems).\n",
      "Identified Problem:\n",
      "The current standards within the existing Land Development Code (LDC) does not fully protect the most productive farm land within Klamath County. Up to 12 acres of high value farmland can be developed as a solar facility through the Conditional Use Permit process. High value farmland is defined as irrigated and classified as Class 1 or 2, prime or unique soils. However, by going through the exception process pursuant to ORS 197.732 and OAR chapter 660 division, an applicant can propose to develop farmland greater than 12 acres into a solar facility. There was a concern that this level of protection was not great enough for the valuable farm land in Klamath County nor gave the communities certainties that large scale solar would not be constructed on lands need for their economies.\n",
      "Within the current standards regarding solar facilities in the LDC, there are no standards or criteria regarding water rights. The retention of water rights is critical for agriculture to continue in Klamath County.\n",
      "Within the current standards regarding solar facilities in the LDC, there is no prohibition on the development of solar facility within the goal 5 adopted deer winter range. There are standards for mitigation; however, there is a concern that the very best deer winter range is not mitigatable. The very best winter range has specific unique physical characteristics such soil type, aspect, elevation, that cannot be duplicated in other areas.\n",
      "It was determined an ordinance was needed to: 1. protect the County’s most productive farm land 2. preserve established water rights 3. protect the best winter deer range 4. establish application standards, criteria, and reporting which are clear and objective.\n",
      "File No. CLUP 8-20 Page 1\n",
      "Background: This process started with Planning Commission being concerned the current standards for siting\n",
      "a solar facility did not address water rights for irrigation. The concern was if the water right for irrigation was not used during a twenty-year lease of the solar facility the water right may be lost forever. The Planning Commission recognized the fact that any proposed solar facility larger than 20 acres on high value farmland would require an exception, and the fact that an exception needs approval from the Board of County Commissions. However, the Planning Commission wanted to try to streamline the process by creating a set of rules to guide the solar industry to lands that would be easier to develop. As discussion regarding the water rights and how to streamline the process continued other problems were discovered. Through a series of work sessions with Planning Commission, Solar Advisory Groups, and large stake holders, staff drafted an Ordinance to address the identified problems, and establish application standards, criteria, and reporting which are clear and objective.\n",
      "Notice of the proposed ordinance was mailed to 9,607 individuals including affected property owners, agencies, non-profits, and businesses. The notification generated hundreds of phone calls and 48 written responses to date.\n",
      "A vast majority of the respondents approved of the protection of the crucial winter big game habitat. However, the solar industry and a large property owner have concerns about a prohibition on solar development within the crucial winter big game habitat. They believe there are opportunities to mitigate habitat, and a prohibition will cut access to some of the existing transmission lines that run through the crucial big game habitat.\n",
      "Most of the comments received focus on the prohibition of solar facilities on class 1, 2, and 3 soils. The number of comments which think the proposed prohibition is too restrictive is almost equal to the number of comments which support the restriction.\n",

      "The applicable criteria are contained in Article 49 — Legislative Amendment to the Klamath County Comprehensive Plan, Land Development Code or Zoning Map.\n",
      "FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n",
      "The applicable criteria are listed below with findings addressing each.\n",
      "Land Development Code Article 49.030 Review Criteria\n",
      "A. An amendment to the Comprehensive Plan or Land Development Code may only be approved if it meets all applicable review criteria.\n",
      "B. An amendment to the Comprehensive Plan or Land Development Code shall be reviewed against the following criteria:\n",
      "1. The proposed amendment is supported by specific studies or other factual information, which documents the public need for the change;\n",
      "File No. CLUP 8-20 Page 2\n",
      "Draft Finding\n",
      "Agriculture is an extremely important part of Klamath County Economy. Klamath County ranked 9\" in the State in total farm and ranch sales in 2012 grossing $185,485,000. That figure only captures the gross sale of agriculture product, it does not capture the secondary sale such as tires, fertilizers, equipment, and so on. In 2016, according to Klamath County Economic Development Strategic Pian nearly 1 out of 3 Kamath County Jobs related to agriculture. Agriculture is a resource base industry which depends on good irrigation. Without good water rights, the industry suffers, along with the all of the secondary businesses that supply goods and services to the agricultural industry.\n",
      "To ensure water rights remain, application for a solar facility shall contain a water rights management plan as required by section XX.030 — Application Requirement. The Water Rights Plan shall meet the criteria found in section XX.040 — General Review Standards\n",
      "The solar industry creates power vital to every aspect of our lives, but it does not produce the employment opportunities needed for a local economy to thrive. Once built solar facility are unmanned except for an occasional inspection. Solar facilities cannot supply the employment needed by the local community, and rural cities to survive.\n",
      "Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife supplied Klamath County with the geographic data showing the highest density of the deer during the winter months. This information was overlaid with the Goal 5 recognized deer winter ranges. With this information, a subset of the recognized Goal 5 deer winter range was created. This new area named Crucial Deer Winter range recognizes the best of best of the winter range. The crucial deer winter range is just a fraction of the adopted Goal 5 Deer Winter ranges. The crucial winter deer range consists of four areas: Pokegama (Keno) — 20,535 acres, Swan — Yonna - 25,579 acres, Langell — 61,769 acres and Bly ~ 49,065 acres totaling 156,947 acres. The adopted Goal 5 deer winter area is 373,119 acres. The crucial winter range proposed for protection from solar development is 42% of the adopted Goal 5 Winter Deer Range and it is only 4% of the entire Klamath County. The Goal 5 deer winter ranges have been adopted in much the same area since 1978. The adopted Goal 5 analysis for the deer winter range identified Extensive Impact Service as a conflicting use in the deer winter range. Extensive Impact Service is defined as: Any public or private facilities, services and utilities which may have a substantial impact on surrounding land uses. Typical uses include, but are not limited to: airports, detention and correction institutions, fairgrounds, disposal sites, incinerators, commercial power generating facilities, sports arenas and stadiums, outdoor theaters and amphitheaters, vehicular raceways, electrical transmission towers over 200 feet in height, commercial communication towers, recycle centers, natural gas or petroleum transmission pipelines, and certain transportation improvements, as specified in Section 50.040.B.\n",
      "Wildlife has significant value to Klamath County, and needs to be protected. To ensure the protection of wildlife, it will be the responsibility of the Applicant to before submitting an application with the County to complete a mitigation plan with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The wildlife mitigation plan must be approved by Oregon Department Fish and Wildlife as required by section XX.025 and reviewed against XX.040 — General Review Standards.\n",

      "The amendment has followed the public hearing procedures for a legislative code amendment, which provides an opportunity for citizen input. A notice of this hearing was sent to property owners within the Crucial Winter Range, and with class |, 2 and 3 soils, to the solar industry, and other stakeholders.\n",
      "Goal 3: Agricultural Lands\n",
      "Draft Finding\n",
      "Policy 2 of Goal 3 in the Klamath County Comprehensive Plan: Agricultural lands shall be designated Exclusive Farm Use ... and shall be subject to the regulations the zone. The rationale of the policy is to promote the quality and quantity of the County’s agricultural resources by maintaining and preserving agricultural lands. The purpose of the ordinances is to preserve water rights for the use of producing agricultural crops. The preservation of agricultural land is a goal of the Klamath Comprehensive Plan and the Oregon State Planning Goals.\n",
      "Goa! 5: Open Space, scenic and Historical Areas, and Natural Resources\n",
      "Draft Finding\n",
      "Policy 12 of Goal 5 in the Klamath County Comprehensive Plan: The County shall protect significant big game winter ranges and other significant wildlife habitat. The rationale behind this policy is twofold: 1) protect wildlife for future generations and 2) maintain the valuable economic resource provided by hunting. The implementation of this goal consists of applying the Significant Resource Overlay (Article 57 of the Land Development Code). The development within the recognized big game winter range shall be limited as part of the implantation of this policy. To ensure compliance with Policy 12 development of solar facility impacts needs to be fully vetted and approved by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife prior to any County approval.\n",
      "Goals Not Applicable\n",
      "Draft Finding\n",
      "It has been determined that Goals 2, Goal 4, and Goals 6 thru 14 in the Klamath County Comprehensive Plan are not applicable to the proposed amendment.\n",
      "3. The proposed amendment complies with the Oregon Statewide Planning Goals, state statutes and administrative rules, including compliance with the TPR (OAR 660-012-0060). To document compliance with the TPR the applicant shall submit a Traffic Impact Study pursuant to Section 71.200.\n",
      "Statewide Planning Goals\n",
      "Draft Finding\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "The Ordinance as written meets the criteria of the Klamath County Land Development Code and therefore if desired can be adopted. However, if Planning Commissioner desires the proposed ordinance can be modified or tabled.\n",
      "There have been a considerable number of comments received regarding the adoption of this ordinance. To generalize the comments, most focused on the provision to protect soils in classes 1 thru 3. Approximately half the comments support the protection of these soils or in some case would like the protection to be even more robust. The other half disagree with the protection of these soils. The comments expressed are concerned with government overreach, and the farmer losing an option for their land.\n",
      "POSSIBLE ACTIONS\n",
      "Recommendation of Approval The Planning Commission can draft Findings that demonstrate compliance with State of Oregon\n",
      "and Klamath County requirements, and forward a recommendation of approval to the Klamath County Board of Commissioners for amendment of the Land Development Code.\n",
      "Continue the Matter Planning Commission can direct staff to make changes to the proposed Ordinance and continue this matter to a later date.\n",
      "Table the Matter Indefinitely If desired the Planning Commission can table the matter indefinitely. If a motion is tabled\n",
      "indefinitely, it is to set a pending motion aside with no particular intention of ever taking it up again.\n",

The project, developed by Hecate Energy LLC and located in the Langell Valley near Lakeview, aims to take advantage of the area's solar potential to generate between 150 to 300 megawatts of carbon-free power, complemented by a substantial battery storage system. Despite these benefits, local residents have raised concerns over water usage, the risk of fire, the impact on local wildlife habitats, including those for migrating deer and sandhill cranes, and decreases in property values due to the visual changes to the landscape. Additionally, the utilization of prime agricultural land for the installation of the solar array has been questioned. Opposition has been voiced through community meetings, with local commissioners also opposing the project citing the loss of agricultural land. In contrast, some community members and entities like Columbia Insight recognize the transition to renewable energy as essential for environmental sustainability. The project's development has catalyzed a debate on balancing renewable energy initiatives with local agricultural preservation and ecological considerations.\"\n",
